Título: A classification approach of sustainability aware requirements methods
Resumo: Sustainability concept is interpreted in different ways within and among disciplines. Thus, software developers must be aware of the extent to which methods used in requirements engineering are supporting this issue. So, this paper aims to classify methods used to develop or manage environmental sustainability (green) requirements as regards three categories: the sustainability notions they rely on, sustainability software view, and sustainability requirements view. The classification approach was validated with 16 papers selected by a Systematic Mapping Study method. As a result, it was found that the reviewed papers focused on sustainability goals related to second order effects and the case studies addressed mainly early requirements during development stage of the software life cycle. Few papers reported requirements validation practices. In a nutshell, the classification approach allowed to identify that requirements engineering methods should consider others sustainability notions and to provide methodological support to derive software requirements from sustainability goals.

Título: A Review of Software Architecture Evaluation Methods for Sustainability Assessment
Resumo: Building sustainability-aware software requires addressing sustainability early in the software development life-cycle. It can be ensured through Software Architecture (SA) evaluation for conformance to sustainability requirements. Typically, software sustainability needs to be assessed across four dimensions (4D): economic, environmental, social and technical. The current literature lacks information about 4D-sustainability awareness of SA evaluation methods. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review to identify, categorize and characterize SA evaluation methods from 71 primary studies to ascertain their applicability for 4D-sustainability evaluation. Our results show that the majority of the methods are scenario-based, and provide support for technical sustainability but lack 4D-sustainability coverage. We conclude that extending the steps of an existing method for sustainability combined with metric-based modeling of 4D-sustainability QAs can aid in 4D-sustainability-aware SA evaluation. Also, continuous SA evaluation needs to be explored for the sustainability of SA over time.

Título: A systematic literature review for software sustainability measures
Resumo: Nowadays, sustainability is a key factor that should be considered in the software quality models. It is increasingly important how environmentally friendly is a software product, both in its execution and during its development process. Therefore, we have proposed, in a previous work, a quality model (25010+S) an extension of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by considering aspects of sustainability on its characteristics and sub-characteristics. However, in order to make the model useful, it is necessary to identify measures for each sub-characteristic and characteristic. For that reason, the objective of this paper is to carry out a Systematic Literature Review to discover the stateof-the art in software sustainability measures.

Título: An Empirical Study on the Use of CDIO in Software Engineering Education
Resumo: Contribution: In this study, we accumulated the knowledge and generated evidence on how and in what context CDIO framework has been used in software engineering (SE) education. The aggregated evidence will enable SE academics in making informed decisions while adopting CDIO for SE education and build upon it. Background: CDIO framework is relevant for SE as it focuses on enabling engineering graduates in conceiving, designing, implementing, and operating complex systems and products. We were not able to find any study that identifies and aggregates the evidence on the use of CDIO for SE education. Research Questions: This study attempts to answer the following research questions: 1) how CDIO has been used in SE education? and 2) what are the experiences of academics in applying the CDIO framework in SE education? Methodology: Using a mixed-method approach (systematic mapping study and interview study with experienced academics in SE), we established the state of the art and practice on the use of CDIO in SE education. Findings: Getting a commitment from the higher management, teachers, and students is a major challenge in the adoption of the CDIO initiative followed by a lack of competence, finance, and resources. Ownership, motivation, persistence, and training of teachers and students are required not only to adopt CDIO for SE but also to sustain it.

Título: Blockchain and Sustainability: A Systematic Mapping Study
Resumo: Sustainability is a topic of increasing interest. The United Nations has released a list of 17 goals for sustainable development for the global community. Blockchain is a recent technological innovation that shows great promise in changing industries. In this paper, we look speciﬁcally at smart grids and supply chain management systems as areas where sustainable technological innovation can happen. To identify software engineering aspects of blockchain in smart grids and supply chain management, we start upon online libraries focusing on engineering and information technology, and we opted for the methodology of systematic mapping studies in software engineering. The search strategy identiﬁed 535 papers, of which 60 were identiﬁed as main studies for our mapping. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no previous similar studies exist. Results of the study show that the research connecting blockchain technology to smart grids and supply chain management systems is still young. None of the techniques or systems have yet been implemented in a real life setting. As such, more work has to be done before we can look at the actual implications of putting such technologies into use. Software engineering practices could prove to be very useful in the process of development. We propose that future studies can focus on bringing the technologies closer to real life implementations, as well as how to involve the end users in the development of the blockchain-based systems.

Título: Challenges and Practices Identification via a Systematic Literature Review in the Adoption of Green Cloud Computing: Client’s Side Approach
Resumo: Green cloud computing gains popularity over the last decade due to the extensive use of cloud computing. The trend towards cloud computing is spreading at a fast rate. Cloud computing providers extend their data centers at regular intervals. However, cloud providers face severe issues about sustaining the environment because big data centers are responsible for consuming a vast amount of energy and producing a carbon footprint. The solution to address such an issue is green cloud computing. In the literature, a considerable amount of research has been done to determine the challenges and practices in adopting green cloud computing. Still, the ﬁeld is immature and needs further research to identify the challenges and practices faced and addressed by various stakeholders. This research focuses on identifying the challenges faced by client organizations in adopting the green cloud and the associated practices for addressing the challenges. The challenges and patterns were identiﬁed via a systematic literature review from the relevant literature. After thorough conduction of the systematic literature review (SLR), we have identiﬁed 9 challenges and 63 practices from 68 papers in the cloud domain. In the future, we plan to develop a comprehensive framework by using some robust soft computing techniques like Fuzzy logic or AHP, etc., to assist the clients in adopting the green cloud environment.

Título: Comparative Analysis of the Advancement of Hydrogen Vehicles and Electric Vehicles: A Critical Review
Resumo: Electric vehicles are rapidly gaining popularity these days. This is due to the air pollution problem since 55.2% of greenhouse gas emissions stem from conventional cars. In contrast, only 5.76% of total air emissions produced emanate from electric cars. Nevertheless, electric cars are not the only environmentally friendly vehicles. Hydrogen vehicles have a fast and cheap recharge and are also as eco-friendly as electric cars, but they have failed to achieve the same success. In this paper, we will analyze the characteristics and compare them and find out how these two types of cars work. And most importantly, we will try to answer the question, "Can hydrogen cars replace electric ones?"

Título: Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment: A Systematic Review on Approaches, Tools, Challenges and Practices
Resumo: Continuous practices, i.e., continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, are the software development industry practices that enable organizations to frequently and reliably release new features and products. With the increasing interest in the literature on continuous practices, it is important to systematically review and synthesize the approaches, tools, challenges, and practices reported for adopting and implementing continuous practices. This paper aimed at systematically reviewing the state of the art of continuous practices to classify approaches and tools, identify challenges and practices in this regard, and identify the gaps for future research. We used the systematic literature review method for reviewing the peer-reviewed papers on continuous practices published between 2004 and June 1, 2016. We applied the thematic analysis method for analyzing the data extracted from reviewing 69 papers selected using predefined criteria. We have identified 30 approaches and associated tools, which facilitate the implementation of continuous practices in the following ways: (1) reducing build and test time in continuous integration (CI); (2) increasing visibility and awareness on build and test results in CI; (3) supporting (semi-) automated continuous testing; (4) detecting violations, flaws, and faults in CI; (5) addressing security and scalability issues in deployment pipeline; and (6) improving dependability and reliability of deployment process. We have also determined a list of critical factors, such as testing (effort and time), team awareness and transparency, good design principles, customer, highly skilled and motivated team, application domain, and appropriate infrastructure that should be carefully considered when introducing continuous practices in a given organization. The majority of the reviewed papers were validation (34.7%) and evaluation (36.2%) research types. This paper also reveals that continuous practices have been successfully applied to both greenfield and maintenance projects. Continuous practices have become an important area of software engineering research and practice. While the reported approaches, tools, and practices are addressing a wide range of challenges, there are several challenges and gaps, which require future research work for improving the capturing and reporting of contextual information in the studies reporting different aspects of continuous practices; gaining a deep understanding of how software-intensive systems should be (re-) architected to support continuous practices; and addressing the lack of knowledge and tools for engineering processes of designing and running secure deployment pipelines.

Título: Developing green and sustainable software: Success factors for vendors
Resumo: Software plays an important role in various aspects of our life. However, recent software development practices have substantial negative impacts (direct and indirect) on economy, society, human beings, and environment. To cope with these issues the concept of Green Software Engineering has boomed recently. Green and sustainable software development aims to create green software that meets the needs of current and future users while minimizing its negative impacts on the environment and society. Green software development is getting attention in Global Software Engineering (GSE). Software development multi-sourcing vendor organizations have focused on the adaptation of green practices in software development projects. The objectives of this study are to identify and scrutinize a list of critical success factors (CSFs) for vendors in the development of green and sustainable software. The required data for conducting the study was taken, via systematic literature review (SLR) process, from a sample of 74 research papers. The SLR findings reveal that 'green software design and efficient coding', 'power­ saving software strategies', 'low carbon emission throughout the software development process', 'efficient resource utilization', 'paperless communication', 'filtration of requirements through green evaluator and e-waste management' are the critical factors to be implanted by vendors in the development of green and sustainable software.

Título: Does Project Associated Situational Factors have Impact on Sustainability of Modern Code Review Workforce?
Resumo: Code review is an essential practice to evaluate the quality of source code. Presently the Modern trend of code review known as Modern Code Review (MCR), an informal modified version of Fagan’s inspection is widely used. In MCR process, MCR workforce that is author and reviewer work together to improve the code quality and software quality. It is a peer-reviewed process, the source code written by the author is evaluated by the reviewer. For the effective outcomes of the MCR process, it is required to focus on the sustainability of the MCR workforce so that they can sustain for a longer and produce the effective outcomes. However, the sustainability of MCR workforce is impacted by the unidentified project-related situational factors. The existing literature of MCR is lacking concerning the identification of project-related situational factors that impact the sustainability of the MCR workforce. Therefore, this study aims to perform the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify the project-related situational factors that can impact the sustainability of the MCR workforce. The situational components are collected into two key classifications, for example, project release management and project attributes. The grounded hypothesis approach has been applied to get final unique and categorized list of project-related situational factors. The identified unique and categorized list of project-related situational components is additionally double checked by the expert panel for their categorizations, naming conventions and suggestions of additional project-related situational factors. The investigation results announced 18 project-related situational factors. The study will be advantageous for experts involved in situational software engineering research as well as the MCR workforce to sustain for longer by overcoming the challenge of unidentified situations.

Título: Green-Agile Maturity Model: An Evaluation Framework for Global Software Development Vendors
Resumo: Agile methods are extensively adapted by software development organizations due to the competitive beneﬁts it offers. In recent years global software development (GSD) projects practice agile methods as prominent methods to deliver the software in increments with utmost user satisfaction and affordable cost. Beside the use of agile methods, the software industry has also considered the green aspect of software, to be in line with the demands of the organizations and the world technological ecosystem. The green and sustainable feature of software should focus both the energy and resource efﬁciency key factors. This phenomenon of embedding the green ﬂavor in software has emerged a new research area, green software engineering, that promises the development of eco-friendly software with minimum energy and use of less computing resources, to trim down the adverse effects on both society and environment. The principal objective of this research study is to design and develop a multi-level Green-Agile Maturity Model (GAMM) to assess the GSD vendors’ agile maturity in terms of green software development. The model has been built in four phases. In phase I and II, systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to identify the success factors and risk factors that either supports or hinders the green and sustainable software development respectively by practicing the agile methods in GSD. The results have been validated from 106 relevant experts, dealing with agile and green software projects, through questionnaire survey. The experts’ demographic represents 25 different countries. We also identiﬁed the industry practices through SLR and survey, to address our identiﬁed critical factors. Phase III of this research deals with development of the GAMM by categorizing the identiﬁed factors into seven Green-Agile maturity levels. A similar approach has been used in other models such as Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), Implementation Maturity Model (IMM) and Software Outsourcing Vendors Readiness Model (SOVRM). In phase IV of this research, ﬁve case studies were conducted at GSD organizations, to evaluate the structure and efﬁcacy of the GAMM, while as a major contribution, this paper presents our developed model, the GAMM, which aims to assess the green-agile maturity of the GSD vendors in terms of green and sustainable software development.

Título: Individual Sustainability Barriers and Mitigation Strategies: Systematic Literature Review Protocol
Resumo: Software engineering supports the development of software systems ensuring ease and success for humanity. However, humanity is facing various complex barriers contributing risk to societies, for instance, lack of sustainable software engineering practices, tools, and methodologies. As a software engineer, one can support and contribute to sustainability by developing sustainable software products through sustainable practices along with managing economic, environmental, social, technical and individual dimensions of sustainability. Software engineering with sustainable practices allows for the development of sustainable software. Sustainability concerning economic, environmental, technical and social dimensions have been well explored in literature but individual sustainability dimensions need insight from researchers. Therefore, there is a need to research from an individual sustainability perspective, so this study presents the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol to identify the individual sustainability barriers along with their mitigation strategies. This research will be helpful for a sustainable software engineering body of knowledge and researchers interested to contribute for sustainability concerns in software engineering, by providing the SLR protocol to identify the prioritized list of barriers and mitigation strategies concerning individual sustainability.

Título: Industrial Energy Management System: Design of a Conceptual Framework Using IoT and Big Data
Resumo: Industrial activities consume a large portion of the total energy demand worldwide and thus significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most effective ways to reduce energy consumption in the industrial sector is to implement an energy management system. Current research into Industrial Energy Management System (IEnMS) remains insufficient, and to the best of our knowledge, a holistic framework for an IEnMS using the Internet of Things (IoT) and big data does not exist. This paper provides a comprehensive systematic literature review of the existing academic publications on IEnMS from where the main requirements and components of an IEnMS are identified. We further verify this study by conducting a detailed survey with specialized employees of ten (10) large companies to acquire expert opinion about using the modern technologies like IoT, big data, and data analytics in IEnMS. We have then proposed a theoretical framework for the IEnMS using IoT, big data and data analytics to construct an effective cyber-physical system architecture including steps from data acquisition to the end-user decision-making process. These findings demonstrate how the suggested framework provides an objective methodology for selecting the most appropriate IEnMS for various businesses based on their specific needs.

Título: IoT-Enabled Smart Waste Management Systems for Smart Cities: A Systematic Review
Resumo: With urbanization, rising income and consumption, the production of waste increases. One of the most important directions in the field of sustainable development is the design and implementation of monitoring and management systems for waste collection and removal. Smart waste management (SWM) involves for example collection and analytics of data from sensors on smart garbage bins (SGBs), management of waste trucks and urban infrastructure; planning and optimization of waste truck routes; etc. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the existing research in the field of systems, applications, and approaches vis-à-vis the collection and processing of solid waste in SWM systems. To achieve this objective, we performed a systematic literature review. This study consists of 173 primary studies selected for analysis and data extraction from the 3,732 initially retrieved studies from 5 databases. We 1) identified the main approaches and services that are applied in the city and SGB-level SWM systems, 2) listed sensors and actuators and analyzed their application in various types of SWM systems, 3) listed the direct and indirect stakeholders of the SWM systems, 4) identified the types of data shared between the SWM systems and stakeholders, and 5) identified the main promising directions and research gaps in the field of SWM systems. Based on an analysis of the existing approaches, technologies, and services, we developed recommendations for the implementation of city-level and SGB-level SWM systems.

Título: Knowledge sharing, a key sustainable practice is on risk: An insight from Modern Code Review
Resumo: Knowledge is the foremost asset to succeed in the area of green sustainable software engineering. Effective knowledge sharing is a crucial objective of companies. However, individuals are not motivated to share knowledge. This study explores knowledge sharing in the context of Modern Code Review (MCR) where engineers assess source code composed by other developers to improve the product quality through knowledge exchange among developers (Author and reviewer). The procedure is profoundly subject to individual associations among developers regarding contribute to the outcomes of MCR such as identifying alternative solutions, code improvement, and knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing is supposed as an important outcome of MCR; however, developers involved in MCR activities are confronted with a lack of knowledge sharing challenge due to a dearth of knowledge sharing motivation. There are different individual factors that might encourage or hinder developers to engage in knowledge sharing. Studies have been performed dependent on information investigation gathered from surveys, interviews and review tools concerning elements affecting MCR, still the literature lacks research regarding factors impacting knowledge sharing aspect in MCR. Hence, this examination performs a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that distinguish individual factors impacting knowledge sharing in MCR. The examination discoveries 34 individual factors such as biasness, cognitive load, time pressure, expertise, etc. The factors are grouped into 7 broad categories utilizing grounded theory. Study discoveries have suggestions for programming specialists involved in MCR activities and researchers interested to perform research in this area to broaden the examination and perform MCR exercises adequately by considering and beating the negative effect of recognized variables.

Título: Practices of Energy Consumption for Sustainable Software Engineering
Resumo: Sustainable Software Engineering, also known as “Green IN Software”, focuses on the production of sustainable software. The traditional software engineering process causes negative influences on the environment, economy and to society. For instance, the energy consumption during the software processing is considered as a first order impact because it directly leads to high costs on energy bills and consequently on the environment. Moreover, the optimization of a process implementation and software development can lead to second order impacts, also referred to as indirect impacts. Finally, the third other impact considers the user’s behaviors and consciousness regarding the concept of sustainability. In order to mitigate these negative impacts, the purpose of this research is to identify, via systematic literature review, the practices of sustainable software engineering reported by the academy applied in the industry. Through the systematic literature review, it was possible to discover 170 practices in which 70 were related to practices of energy consumption that could be adopted during the software development. Our results indicate that those practices emerged from the grounded theory, which are part of SWEBOK areas and are applicable in the industry.

Título: Preliminary Empirical Identification of Barriers Faced by Newcomers to Open Source Software Projects
Resumo: When newcomers try to join an open source software (OSS) project, they face many barriers that hinder their first contribution, leading in many cases to their dropping out. Many projects leverage the contribution of outsiders, and the sustainability of the project relies on retaining some of these newcomers. This research aims to identify the barriers that hinder newcomers' onboarding to OSS projects. Our method consisted of a qualitative study conducted with data obtained from four different sources: (i) systematic literature review; (ii) feedback from nine graduate and undergraduate students after they tried to join OSS projects; (iii) 24 responses to a questionnaire sent to 9 OSS projects; and (iv) semi-structured interviews with 36 subjects from 14 different projects, including newcomers and experienced members. The method to select the candidate papers in the systematic literature review was querying four digital libraries and backward snowballing. The data obtained from the practitioners from all three sources, and the primary studies obtained in the systematic review were analyzed using used procedures of Grounded Theory's open and axial coding. The analysis resulted in a conceptual model composed of 58 barriers, grouped into six different categories: cultural differences, newcomers' characteristics, reception issues, orientation, technical hurdles, and documentation problems. We could observe recurrent barriers evidenced in different data sources. We could notice that the onboarding process of a newcomer to an OSS can be a tough task. This research brings empirical support relying on data from different sources, organizes and discusses the existing common wisdom about barriers faced by newcomers to OSS projects, which deserve attention from researchers and OSS communities.

Título: Situational factors affecting Software Engineers Sustainability: A Vision of Modern Code Review
Resumo: Code review is a sustainable software engineering practice to assure software quality. Presently it is performed by software engineers with the help of tool support, for instance, Gerrit and termed as Modern Code Review (MCR). It is a lightweight way to deal with distinguishing abandons from source code. Software engineer’s efficiency while performing MCR activities is exposed to varying people related situational factors that impact the software engineer’s sustainability. The literature lacks the identification of people related situational factors in MCR. For successful MCR results, there is a need to distinguish people concerning situational factors to enhance the productivity and competence of software engineers for their sustainability. Therefore, this investigation intends to recognize situational variables influencing the ability and efficiency of software engineers. The systematic methodology utilized for this examination is Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The study results reported 52 situational factors. The situational factors are assembled into four fundamental classifications such as team, team interaction, reviewer response and knowledge sharing. The grounded theory approach has been applied to get final unique list of people related situational factors and sub factors. The investigation will be useful for expert performing examination seeing situational factors as well as the sustainability of software engineers engaged with MCR activities.

Título: Software Sustainability in Customer-Driven Courses
Resumo: Context: Software sustainability is an emergent topic in an age when software is becoming ever more ubiquitous. We, as researchers, have the responsibility of ensuring the dissemination of sustainable software developments in the industry and academic contexts before enacting the creation of a body of knowledge in software sustainability. Our paper presents a review of project descriptions from a project-based course designed in close collaboration with students and external customers. Our master’s course is based on four decades of software engineering experience and teaching at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. In the scope of this work, we analyzed 45 customers’ project proposals over the past three years to identify the social and technical sustainability addressed by the proposals. Objectives: More precisely, we investigated 1) how software social sustainability topics are introduced from customers’ project descriptions, 2) how software technical sustainability is addressed from customers’ project descriptions, and 3) the extent to which software environmental and economical sustainability is addressed from customers’ project descriptions. Method: We conducted a deductive thematic analysis utilizing open coding of customers’ project descriptions. Results: We found that customers’ project descriptions moderately addressed social sustainability for specific target groups. Technical sustainability is also addressed by a little more than half of the overall projects. However, we observed that no effort was made to address environmental and economic sustainability. Contribution: The study’s overall findings contribute to the future improvement of the course and help inform customers about prospective socially relevant project proposals.

Título: Software Techniques for Making Cloud Data Centers Energy-efficient: A Systematic Mapping Study
Resumo: Due to high demand, many cloud data centers have been developed across the world, consuming a large amount of energy. Making cloud datacenters energy efficient has become essential. Energy consumption of data centers can be minimized by designing energy-efficient hardware, software, and infrastructure. In this paper, we aim at giving an overview of software techniques, affected stakeholders, performance features, datasets, and tools used to make cloud data centers energy-efficient. To achieve this goal, we conducted a systematic mapping study using five online databases. After applying inclusion/exclusion and quality criteria, we selected 58 publications for further analysis. Our results indicate that all publications are solution and validation type of publications. We did not find publications containing evaluations in industry. We found that workload scheduling is the most frequently proposed technique used to improve cloud datacenters’ energy efficiency. We found that not considering violations of service level agreements mostly affects end-users of cloud data centers. When analyzing how suggested solutions are validated, we identified the need to develop a standardized set of performance measures to benchmark software techniques proposed to make cloud data centers greener.

Título: Sustainability in Software Architecture: A Systematic Mapping Study
Resumo: Sustainability is an increasingly-studied topic in software engineering in general, and in software architecture in particular. There are already a number of secondary studies addressing sustainability in software engineering, but no such study focusing explicitly on software architecture. This work aims to ﬁll this gap by conducting a systematic mapping study on the intersection between sustainability and software architecture research with the intention of (i) reﬂecting on the current state of the art, and (ii) identifying the needs for further research. Our results show that, overall, existing works have focused disproportionately on speciﬁc aspects of sustainability, and in particular on the most technical and “inward facing” ones. This comes at the expense of the holistic perspective required to address a multi-faceted concern such as sustainability. Furthermore, more reﬂection-oriented research works, and better coverage of the activities in the architecting life cycle are required to further the maturity of the area. Based on our ﬁndings we then propose a research agenda for sustainability-aware software architecture.

Título: Sustainability in software engineering: a systematic literature review
Resumo: Method: The applied method is a SLR in ﬁve reliable and commonly-used databases according to the (quasi-standard) protocol by Kitchenham et al. [1]. We assessed the 100 ﬁrst results of each database ordered by relevance with respect to the search query. Results: Of 500 classiﬁed publications, we regard 96 as relevant for our research questions. We sketch a taxonomy of their topics and domains, and provide lists of used methods and proposed approaches. Most of the excluded publications were ruled out because of an unﬁtting usage of terms within the search query. Conclusions: Currently, there is little research coverage on the different aspects of sustainability in software engineering while other disciplines are already more active. Future work includes extending the study by reviewing a higher number of publications, including dedicated journal and workshop searches, and snowballing.

However; these pillars are theoretically underdeveloped and require reﬁnement. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to generate a better theory of SSE. Method: First, a scoping review was conducted to understand the state of research on SSE and identify existing models thereof. Next, a meta-synthesis of qualitative research on SSE was conducted to critique and improve the existing models identiﬁed. Results: 961 potentially relevant articles were extracted from ﬁve article databases. These articles were de-duplicated and then screened independently by two screeners, leaving 243 articles to examine. Of these, 109 were non-empirical, the most common empirical method was systematic review, and no randomized controlled experiments were found. Most papers focus on ecological sustainability (158) and the sustainability of software products (148) rather than processes. A meta-synthesis of 36 qualitative studies produced several key propositions, most notably, that sustainability is stratiﬁed (has different meanings at different levels of abstraction) and multisystemic (emerges from interactions among multiple social, technical, and sociotechnical systems). Conclusion: The academic literature on SSE is surprisingly non-empirical. More empirical evaluations of speciﬁc sustainability interventions are needed. The sustainability of software development products and processes should be conceptualized as multisystemic and stratiﬁed, and assessed accordingly.

Título: The Influence Factors of Knowledge Resilience in Sustaining Knowledge Network in Smart Cities Environment
Resumo: The smart cities concept has become a globally engaging topic among researchers, practitioners, and decisionmakers in the last decade. There are many advantages in upgrading urban infrastructure and services in order to sustain current cities. However, the most significant challenge is how to ensure that the knowledge network remains resilient within the environment of smart cities, in order to sustain them. Knowledge resilience has been thought to bring numerous benefits to smart cities. This study aims to review the extent to which knowledge resilience influence knowledge network in smart cities. This study employs the systematic literature review methodology as a guideline in order to identify, evaluate and interpret all the available research on the knowledge resilience factor and smart cities. Eight factors that influenced knowledge resilience in smart cities were identified. Understanding these factors in relation to knowledge resilience will contribute to potential development and successful advancements of smart and sustainable cities.

Título: Toward Successful DevOps: A Decision-Making Framework
Resumo: DevOps (development and operations) is a set of collaborative practices that automate delivery of new software updates with the aim to reduce the development life cycle and produce quality software products. Software organizations face several barriers while adopting DevOps practices as the integration of development and operation teams requires merger of different processes, tools, and skill sets. This study aims to develop a prioritization-based framework of the DevOps best practices based on evidence collected from industry experts. To attain the study aims, firstly, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify DevOps best practices reported in the literature. Next, a questionnaire survey study was conducted to receive insight from industry practitioners for the identified best practice. Finally, the fuzzy-AHP technique was applied to prioritize the best practices concerning to the significance for DevOps process. We believe that the identified best practices, their categorization and fuzzy-AHP based framework will help industry experts to revise and improve their strategies to make the DevOps process sustainable.

Título: What Makes Research Software Sustainable? An Interview Study with Research Software Engineers
Resumo: Software is now a vital scientiﬁc instrument, providing the tools for data collection and analysis across disciplines from bioinformatics and computational physics, to the humanities. The software used in research is often home-grown and bespoke: it is constructed for a particular project, and rarely maintained beyond this, leading to rapid decay, and frequent ‘reinvention of the wheel’. Understanding how to develop sustainable research software, such that it is suitable for future reuse, is therefore of interest to both researchers and funders, but how to achieve this remains an open question. Here we report the results of an interview study examining how research software engineers – the people actively developing software in an academic research environment – subjectively deﬁne software sustainability. Thematic analysis of the data reveals two interacting dimensions: intrinsic sustainability, which relates to internal qualities of software, such as modularity, encapsulation and testability, and extrinsic sustainability, concerning cultural and organisational factors, including how software is resourced, supported and shared. Research software engineers believe an increased focus on quality and discoverability are key factors in increasing the sustainability of academic research software.
