Título: A "design-pattern"-based approach for analyzing e-health business models
Resumo: Background: While many e-health initiatives and projects were launched in the last couple of years, a large number of them failed or are prone to fail. These initiatives either missed to articulate a clear value proposition to patients or lacked a sustainable profit generation formula. Purpose: A core problem is the difficulty to understand and express the business logic behind e-health services in today's complex environment. Therefore, it is the aim of this study to provide appropriate means to analyze and explain business logics of e-health service provisions. Methods: The study is of ethnographic nature, since business logics were studied in their social and cultural context. Furthermore, insights were gathered from a thematic literature review on business models in the healthcare sector. Results: Based on the "design pattern" concept applied in architecture and software engineering, three distinct examples of archetypical design solutions of successful business models are discussed. Conclusions: Explanations of the different, isolated business logics can help to increase the understanding of value creation and revenue mechanisms. Findings of this study provide e-health marketers with a tool set to develop more sustainable business models. They facilitate further research on innovation and experimentation with different business model designs. © 2012 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine.

Título: A Review of Software Architecture Evaluation Methods for Sustainability Assessment
Resumo: Building sustainability-aware software requires addressing sustainability early in the software development life-cycle. It can be ensured through Software Architecture (SA) evaluation for conformance to sustainability requirements. Typically, software sustainability needs to be assessed across four dimensions (4D): economic, environmental, social and technical. The current literature lacks information about 4D-sustainability awareness of SA evaluation methods. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review to identify, categorize and characterize SA evaluation methods from 71 primary studies to ascertain their applicability for 4D-sustainability evaluation. Our results show that the majority of the methods are scenario-based, and provide support for technical sustainability but lack 4D-sustainability coverage. We conclude that extending the steps of an existing method for sustainability combined with metric-based modeling of 4D-sustainability QAs can aid in 4D-sustainability-aware SA evaluation. Also, continuous SA evaluation needs to be explored for the sustainability of SA over time.

Título: A social and technical sustainability requirements catalogue
Resumo: Climate change calls for action from all sectors of our global economy, including ICT. Therefore, it is important to change the way we develop software to address the challenges posed by sustainability. Our goal is to contribute with a reusable sustainability requirements catalogue that helps developers be aware of sustainability-related properties worth considering during software development. The information for this catalogue was gathered via a systematic mapping study, whose results were synthesised in feature models and then modelled using iStar for a more expressive and configurable representation. A qualitative evaluation of the catalogue's readability, interest, utility, and usefulness by 50 participants from the domain, showed that around 79% of the respondents found the catalogue “Good” or “Very Good”. However, more than 5% of the expert participants found weaknesses regarding most of the evaluated questions and around 25% are neutral in their overall evaluation. This led us to evolve the initial version of the catalogue for the social and technical dimensions of sustainability to improve its completeness and usefulness. This is achieved by aligning the information gathered in the systematic mapping study with the well-established quality model of the ISO/IEC 25010:2011, as we expect most of the experts are familiar with those qualities and respective hierarchies. During this process, we found information that led us to propose two additional qualities that were not covered by the ISO standard: fairness and legislation. We applied this evolved version of the catalogue to the U-Bike project comparing the requirements elicited without the catalogue with those identified using the catalogue. The result suggests that new sustainability requirements were worth considering from a sustainability point of view, supporting the usefulness of the catalogue. © 2022 The Author(s)

Título: A systematic examination of knowledge loss in open source software projects
Resumo: Context Open Source Software (OSS) development is a knowledge focussed activity which relies heavily on contributors who can be volunteers or paid workers and are geographically distributed. While working on OSS projects contributors acquire project related individualistic knowledge and gain experience and skills, which often remains unshared with others and is usually lost once contributors leave a project. All software development organisations face the problem of knowledge loss as employees leave, but this situation is exasperated in OSS projects where most contributors are volunteers with largely unpredictable engagement durations. Contributor turnover is inevitable due to the transient nature of OSS project workforces causing knowledge loss, which threatens the overall sustainability of OSS projects and impacts negatively on software quality and contributor productivity. Objective: The objective of this work is to deeply and systematically investigate the phenomenon of knowledge loss due to contributor turnover in OSS projects as presented in the state-of-the-art literature and to synthesise the information presented on the topic. Furthermore, based on the learning arising from our investigation it is our intention to identify mechanisms to reduce the overall effects of knowledge loss in OSS projects. Methodology: We use the snowballing methodology to identify the relevant literature on knowledge loss due to contributor turnover in OSS projects. This robust methodology for a literature review includes research question, search strategy, inclusion, exclusion, quality criteria, and data synthesis. The search strategy, and inclusion, exclusions and quality criteria are applied as a part of snowballing procedure. Snowballing is considered an efficient and reliable way to conduct a systematic literature review, providing a robust alternative to mechanically searching individual databases for given topics. Result: Knowledge sharing in OSS projects is abundant but there is no evidence of a formal strategy or practice to manage knowledge. Due to the dynamic and diverse nature of OSS projects, knowledge management is considered a challenging task and there is a need for a proactive mechanism to share knowledge in the OSS community for knowledge to be reused in the future by the OSS project contributors. From the collection of papers found using snowballing, we consolidated various themes on knowledge loss due to contributor turnover in OSS projects and identified 11 impacts due to knowledge loss in OSS projects, and 10 mitigations to manage with knowledge loss in OSS projects. Conclusion: In this paper, we propose future research directions to investigate integration of proactive knowledge retention practices with the existing OSS practices to reduce the current knowledge loss problem. We suggest that there is insufficient attention paid to KM in general in OSS, in particular there would appear to an absence of proactive measures to reduce the potential impact of knowledge loss. We also propose the need for a KM evaluation metric in OSS projects, similar to the ones that evaluate health of online communities, which should help to inform potential consumers of the OSS of the KM status on a project, something that is not existent today. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Título: A Systematic Literature Review on Agile Coaching and the Role of the Agile Coach
Resumo: There has been a recent increase in the use of agile coaches in organizations. Although the use of the job title is popular, empirical knowledge about the tasks, responsibilities and skills of an agile coach is lacking. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review on agile coaching and the role of the agile coach. The initial search resulted in a total of 209 studies identified on the topic. Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 67 studies were selected as primary studies. Our findings suggest that agile coaching facilitates the adoption and sustainability of agile methods and deals with agile adoption challenges. Agile coaches help in training and developing software development teams and all the stakeholders involved in the agile adoption process. The primary skills of an agile coach identified herein are leadership qualities, project management skills, technical skills, and expertise in agile methods. Based on the findings, it can be argued that agile coaches play a significant role in addressing challenges in an agile transformation such as resistance to change. Coaches focus on removing barriers to team autonomy in agile teams and making agile meetings more valuable. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Título: A systematic literature review on software measurement programs
Resumo: Context Software measurement programs (MPs) are an important means for understanding, evaluating, managing, and improving software processes, products and resources. However, implementing successful MPs still remains a challenge. Objectives To make a comprehensive review of the studies on MPs for bringing into light the existing measurement planning models and tools used for implementing MPs,the accumulated knowledge on the success/failure factors of MPs and mitigation strategies to address their challenges. Methods A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted. In total, 65primary studies were reviewed and analyzed. Results We identified 35 measurement planning models and 11 associated tools, most of which either proposed extensions or improvements for goal based approaches. The identified success factors include (a) organizational adoption of MP, (b) integration of MP with SDLC, (c) synchronization of MP with SPI and (d) design of MP. The mostly mentioned mitigation strategies for addressing challenges are effective change management and measurement stakeholder management, automated tool support and incorporation of engineering mechanisms for designing sustainable, effective, scalable and extendible MPs, and measurement expertise and standards development. Conclusion Most of the success factors and mitigation strategies have interdependencies. Therefore, for successful MP implementation, software organizations should consider these factors in combination and make a feasibility study at the very beginning. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Título: A systematic literature review on the use of big data for sustainable tourism
Resumo: Sustainable tourism research focuses on mitigating or remediating environmental, social and economic impacts on tourism. In the past years, Big Data approaches have been applied to the field of tourism allowing for remarkable progress. However, there seems to be little evidence to support that such approaches are an inspiration to sustainable tourism and are being implemented. In this context, we aim to obtain a comprehensive overview of the use of Big Data in sustainable tourism to address various issues and understand how Big Data can support decision-making in such scenarios. To that end, this paper reports on the results of a literature review via a combination of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in Software Engineering, and the use of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method. In summary, we investigated four facets: (a) sources of big data, (b) approaches, (c) purposes, and (d) contexts of application. The results suggest that the use of various approaches have impacted practices in sustainable tourism. The findings provide a thorough understanding of the state of the art of Big Data application in sustainable tourism and provide valuable insights to foster growth both in terms of research and practice. © 2021 The Author(s).

Título: A systematic literature review to explore traceability and lifecycle relationship
Resumo: Traceability is the ability to follow a product along its lifecycle. It ensures product safety and quality along the supply chain, managing information generated by several players. Even though regulations establish the information that has to be traced, each player generates much more product (and process) information, which could be used to add value to products, with respect to, not only traceability, but also the lifecycle approach. However, the concepts do not appear to be immediately related in scientific panorama. This paper aims to explore the relationship between traceability and lifecycle through a systematic literature review. Six industries (Software, Manufacturing, Automotive, Automation, Aircraft, and Aerospace) and seven subject areas (Software engineering; System engineering; Industry 4.0; New product development; Process management; Data Management; and Environmental sustainability) were identified through bibliometric analysis. To better explore this relationship in the context of the food industry, a content analysis on lead papers’ sample was performed to identify traceability and lifecycle definitions, methodologies and technologies and their relation. The results of the work, synthetised in a proposed research map, will be of interest to those who are approaching the subject for the first time, and for companies involved in product lifecycle management and food traceability. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Título: A systematic mapping study of MMOG backend architectures
Resumo: The advent of utility computing has revolutionized almost every sector of traditional software development. Especially commercial cloud computing services, pioneered by the likes of Amazon, Google and Microsoft, have provided an unprecedented opportunity for the fast and sustainable development of complex distributed systems. Nevertheless, existing models and tools aim primarily for systems where resource usage-by humans and bots alike-is logically and physically quite disperse resulting in a low likelihood of conflicting resource access. However, a number of resource-intensive applications, such as Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) and large-scale simulations introduce a requirement for a very large common state with many actors accessing it simultaneously and thus a high likelihood of conflicting resource access. This paper presents a systematic mapping study of the state-of-the-art in software technology aiming explicitly to support the development of MMOGs, a class of large-scale, resource-intensive software systems. By examining the main focus of a diverse set of related publications, we identify a list of criteria that are important for MMOG development. Then, we categorize the selected studies based on the inferred criteria in order to compare their approach, unveil the challenges faced in each of them and reveal research trends that might be present. Finally we attempt to identify research directions which appear promising for enabling the use of standardized technology for this class of systems. © 2019 by the authors.

Título: A Systematic-Oriented Process for Tool Selection: The Case of Green and Technical Debt Tools in Architecture Reconstruction
Resumo: Well-established methods in software engineering research, such as Systematic Literature Reviews, Systematic Mappings and Case Studies are effective research methods to explore emerging areas, since they are systematic and replicable, and produce reusable result avoiding bias. Frequently, software engineers have to evaluate and select CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools that address trending issues with a non-systematic and replicable processes. This work addresses this problem by tailoring the ISO/IEC 14102:2008 to a systematic-oriented process for the evaluation of software engineering CASE tools in order to embrace the advantages of software engineering systematic methods in the exploration of new areas or emerging issues. This tailored ISO/IEC 14102:2008 standard prescribes a process for the preparation, design and conduction of the software engineering CASE tools evaluation and selection. This process is founded in the application of systematic methods and the generation of a pre-established assets to ensure the reusability of knowledge. In this paper, this tailored process has been applied to address two great emerging concerns in architectural reconstruction: technical debt and energy consumption. As result of this adoption, this paper details the reporting analysis and the set of reusable assets that have been generated during the evaluation process. Specifically, this contribution presents a set of tables, statistics and a decision-making tree of the selected tools for technical debt and energy consumption analysis in architecture reconstruction. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Título: Affordances and agency in students’ use of online platforms and resources beyond curricular boundaries
Resumo: This study explored how agency is expressed when undergraduate students cross curricular boundaries to learn software development by realising affordances enabled by resources on online platforms. The study employed a qualitative research design based on individual stimulated recall interviews with 27 computer and software engineering students. The hybrid thematic analysis employed an ecological framework in which the actions the students performed during software development tasks were interpreted in relational terms. The results reveal multiple interrelated affordances that were realised as the students learnt by using various resources on different online platforms. Agency was expressed primarily through students pursuing specific objectives related to their learning across platforms and curricular boundaries and was shared and distributed across people and the environment. The findings highlight the idea that boundaries are formed and crossed based on how people experience the environment, which, in turn, is enabled or constrained by the resources used. © 2023 The Author(s).

Título: Agile challenges in practice: A thematic analysis
Resumo: As agile is maturing and becoming more widely adopted, it is important that researchers are aware of the challenges faced by practitioners and organisations. We undertook a thematic analysis of 193 agile challenges collected at a series of agile conferences and events during 2013 and 2014. Participants were mainly practitioners and business representatives along with some academics. The challenges were thematically analysed by separate authors, synthesised, and a list of seven themes and 27 sub-themes was agreed. Themes were Organisation, Sustainability, Culture, Teams, Scale, Value and Claims and Limitations. We compare our findings against previous attempts to identify and categorise agile challenges. While most themes have persisted we found a shift of focus towards sustainability, business engagement and transformation, as well as claims and limitations. We identify areas for further research and a need for innovative methods of conveying academic research to industry and industrial problems to academia. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Título: Agile practices for global software development vendors in the development of green and sustainable software
Resumo: Over the last decade, the use of agile methods has grown dramatically for software development. Agile methods guarantee to accelerate the delivery of remarkable software with increased user satisfaction and reduced cost. However, in recent years, due to emergence of green software engineering, software developers are compelled to focus more on green and sustainable aspects of software. Global software engineering aims to design, develop, and use a software with limited energy and computing resources. Recently, software engineers in global software development (GSD) have adapted agile methods for quick, interactive, and environment‐friendly software development. However, there is a lack of specific practices to be followed by GSD vendors in the development of green and sustainable software.

Título: Agile Software Requirements Engineering Challenges-Solutions—A Conceptual Framework from Systematic Literature Review
Resumo: Agile software requirements engineering processes enable quick responses to reflect changes in the client’s software requirements. However, there are challenges associated with agile requirements engineering processes, which hinder fast, sustainable software development. Research addressing the challenges with available solutions is patchy, diverse and inclusive. In this study, we use a systematic literature review coupled with thematic classification and gap mapping analysis to examine extant solutions against challenges; the typologies/classifications of challenges faced with agile software development in general and specifically in requirements engineering and how the solutions address the challenges. Our study covers the period from 2009 to 2023. Scopus—the largest database for credible academic publications was searched. Using the exclusion criteria to filter the articles, a total of 78 valid papers were selected and reviewed. Following our investigation, we develop a framework that takes a three-dimensional view of agile requirements engineering solutions and suggest an orchestrated approach balancing the focus between the business context, project management and agile techniques. This study contributes to the theoretical frontier of agile software requirement engineering approaches and guidelines for practice. © 2023 by the authors.

Título: An Ecological Perspective towards the Evolution of Quantitative Studies in Software Engineering
Resumo: Context: Two of the most common external threats to validity in quantitative studies in software engineering (SE) are concerned with defining the population by convenience and nonrandom sampling assignment. Although these limitations can be reduced by increasing the number of replications and aggregating their results, the acquired evidence rarely can be generalized to the field.Objective: To investigate the state of practice of meta-analysis in SE and its limitations, intending to propose an alternative perspective to understand the relationships among experimentation, production, threats to validity and evidence. To propose and evaluate means to strengthen quantitative studies in software engineering and making them less risky due to population and sampling issues.Method: To use the underlying idea from the Theory of Food Chains to alternatively understand the impact of external threats to validity in the SE experimental cycle (experimental chains). Next, to accomplish an initial technical literature survey to observe basic features of secondary studies aggregating primary studies results. Third, to organize a set of experimental chain's concepts and make initial discussions regarding the observed secondary studies concerned with this metaphor.Results: By applying the experimental chains concepts it was initially observed that, although important and necessary, most of the current effort in the conduction of quantitative studies in SE does not produce (mainly due to population/sampling constraints) results strong enough to positively impact the engineering of software. It promotes an imbalance between research and practice. However, more investigation is necessary to support this claim.Conclusion: We argue that research energy has been lost in SE studies due to population/sampling constraints. Therefore, we believe more investigation must be undertaken to understand how better organizing, enlarging, setting up and sampling SE quantitative studies' population by using, for instance, alternative technologies such as social networks or other crowdsourcing technologies.

Título: An Empirical Study on the Use of CDIO in Software Engineering Education
Resumo: Contribution: In this study, we accumulated the knowledge and generated evidence on how and in what context CDIO framework has been used in software engineering (SE) education. The aggregated evidence will enable SE academics in making informed decisions while adopting CDIO for SE education and build upon it. Background: CDIO framework is relevant for SE as it focuses on enabling engineering graduates in conceiving, designing, implementing, and operating complex systems and products. We were not able to find any study that identifies and aggregates the evidence on the use of CDIO for SE education. Research Questions: This study attempts to answer the following research questions: 1) how CDIO has been used in SE education? and 2) what are the experiences of academics in applying the CDIO framework in SE education? Methodology: Using a mixed-method approach (systematic mapping study and interview study with experienced academics in SE), we established the state of the art and practice on the use of CDIO in SE education. Findings: Getting a commitment from the higher management, teachers, and students is a major challenge in the adoption of the CDIO initiative followed by a lack of competence, finance, and resources. Ownership, motivation, persistence, and training of teachers and students are required not only to adopt CDIO for SE but also to sustain it.

Resumo: Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns are widely approved solutions for recurring software design problems, and their beneﬁts to software quality are extensively studied. However, the occurrence of bad smells in design patterns increases the crisis of degenerating design patterns’ structure and behavior. Their occurrences are detrimental to the beneﬁts of design patterns and they inﬂuence software sustainability by increasing maintenance costs and energy consumption. Despite the destructive roles of bad smells in such designs, there are an absence of studies systematically reviewing bad smells of GoF design patterns. This study systematically reviews a 10-year state of the art sample, identifying 16 studies investigating this phenomenon. Following a thorough evaluation of the full contents, we observed that the occurrence of bad smells have been investigated in proportion to four granularity levels of analysis: Design level, category level, pattern level, and role level. We identiﬁed 28 bad smells, categorized under code smells and grime symptoms, and emphasized their relationship with GoF pattern types and categories. The utilization of design pattern bad smell detection approaches and datasets were also discussed. Consequently, we observed that the research phenomenon is growing intensively, with a prominent focus of studies analyzing code smell occurrences rather than grime occurrences, at various granularity levels. Finally, we uncovered research gaps and areas with signiﬁcant potentials for future research.

Título: Blinded by Simplicity: Locating the Social Dimension in Software Development Process Literature
Resumo: The software development process is a complex human, intellectual and labor-intensive activity and human related factors have shown to be the most significant contributors to software system failures. Lacking the ability to identify or quantify these factors, software practitioners will not learn from the failures caused by them. Although, social factors give rise to high failure rates in software development projects they tend to be ignored. Business continues as usual. The inability for software engineers to attain a holistic and inclusive approach will leave the social dimension out and undermine the realization of a fully sustainable software development process.This paper builds on the master's thesis with the same title completed in December 2019 at Stockholm University. The thesis demonstrates how research literature on software development processes addresses (or not) the social dimension of sustainability from a holistic point of view. The results indicate that the practice of dealing holistically with complexity including the social dimension is still underdeveloped. Further research is suggested regarding the development of adequate supporting tools, social skills, and managerial attitudes and behaviors.

Título: Blockchain and Sustainability: A Systematic Mapping Study
Resumo: Sustainability is a topic of increasing interest. The United Nations has released a list of 17 goals for sustainable development for the global community. Blockchain is a recent technological innovation that shows great promise in changing industries. In this paper, we look speciﬁcally at smart grids and supply chain management systems as areas where sustainable technological innovation can happen. To identify software engineering aspects of blockchain in smart grids and supply chain management, we start upon online libraries focusing on engineering and information technology, and we opted for the methodology of systematic mapping studies in software engineering. The search strategy identiﬁed 535 papers, of which 60 were identiﬁed as main studies for our mapping. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no previous similar studies exist. Results of the study show that the research connecting blockchain technology to smart grids and supply chain management systems is still young. None of the techniques or systems have yet been implemented in a real life setting. As such, more work has to be done before we can look at the actual implications of putting such technologies into use. Software engineering practices could prove to be very useful in the process of development. We propose that future studies can focus on bringing the technologies closer to real life implementations, as well as how to involve the end users in the development of the blockchain-based systems.

Título: Classifications of Sustainable Factors in Blockchain Adoption: A Literature Review and Bibliometric Analysis
Resumo: Blockchain is a cutting-edge technology that is transforming and reshaping many industries. Hence, the adoption of Blockchain is becoming an increasingly significant topic. The number of publications discussing the potential of Blockchain adoption has been expanding significantly. In addition, not enough attention has been given to Blockchain adoption in the software development industry. As a result, a systematic overview to investigate the research trends in this area is needed. This study uses a Scientometric analysis and critical review to examine the evolution of Blockchain adoption research on the Web of Science Principal Collection. In addition, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify gaps in Blockchain adoption research and the top reasons for adopting Blockchain with the intention of proposing a sustainable adoption framework. This study extends the body of knowledge by discussing the most influential countries, authors, organizations, publication themes, and most cited publications on Blockchain adoption research. Additionally, this study identifies the 30 relevant studies from the Web of Science and Scopus, including their industries, countries, methods, and respondent sample size, and the top 18 adoption factors among them. Consequently, this study proposes a suitable Blockchain adoption framework based on these top 18 factors. Finally, this study’s aim and unique contribution is to serve as an initial launching point for upcoming Blockchain adoption in software development industry research. © 2022 by the authors.

Título: Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment: A Systematic Review on Approaches, Tools, Challenges and Practices
Resumo: Continuous practices, i.e., continuous integration, delivery, and deployment, are the software development industry practices that enable organizations to frequently and reliably release new features and products. With the increasing interest in the literature on continuous practices, it is important to systematically review and synthesize the approaches, tools, challenges, and practices reported for adopting and implementing continuous practices. This paper aimed at systematically reviewing the state of the art of continuous practices to classify approaches and tools, identify challenges and practices in this regard, and identify the gaps for future research. We used the systematic literature review method for reviewing the peer-reviewed papers on continuous practices published between 2004 and June 1, 2016. We applied the thematic analysis method for analyzing the data extracted from reviewing 69 papers selected using predefined criteria. We have identified 30 approaches and associated tools, which facilitate the implementation of continuous practices in the following ways: (1) reducing build and test time in continuous integration (CI); (2) increasing visibility and awareness on build and test results in CI; (3) supporting (semi-) automated continuous testing; (4) detecting violations, flaws, and faults in CI; (5) addressing security and scalability issues in deployment pipeline; and (6) improving dependability and reliability of deployment process. We have also determined a list of critical factors, such as testing (effort and time), team awareness and transparency, good design principles, customer, highly skilled and motivated team, application domain, and appropriate infrastructure that should be carefully considered when introducing continuous practices in a given organization. The majority of the reviewed papers were validation (34.7%) and evaluation (36.2%) research types. This paper also reveals that continuous practices have been successfully applied to both greenfield and maintenance projects. Continuous practices have become an important area of software engineering research and practice. While the reported approaches, tools, and practices are addressing a wide range of challenges, there are several challenges and gaps, which require future research work for improving the capturing and reporting of contextual information in the studies reporting different aspects of continuous practices; gaining a deep understanding of how software-intensive systems should be (re-) architected to support continuous practices; and addressing the lack of knowledge and tools for engineering processes of designing and running secure deployment pipelines.

Título: Developing Green and Sustainable Software using Agile Methods in Global Software Development: Risk Factors for Vendors:
Resumo: Global software development (GSD) is gaining momentum due to the potential benefits it offers. GSD aims at delivering remarkable software through a widely distributed pool of experts, with reduced efforts, minimum cost and time. In recent years, GSD developers have reshaped the development processes and have adopted agile techniques and green engineering principles to cope with the frequent changes in requirements, accelerate the development in short increments and to produce energy efficient and sustainable software. However, the adoption of agile methods for developing sustainable software possesses a number of challenges. This paper presents a list of potential challenges/risks identified through systematic literature review (SLR) that need to be avoided by the GSD vendors using agile methods for the development of green and sustainable software. Our findings reveal eight risk factors that are faced by GSD vendors in the development of green and sustainable software using agile methods. GSD vendors are encouraged to address properly all the identified factors in general and the most-frequently cited critical risks in particular, such as in-sufficient system documentation, limited support for real-time systems and large systems, management overhead, lack of customer’s presence, lack of formal communication and lack of long term planning.

Título: Developing green and sustainable software: Success factors for vendors
Resumo: Software plays an important role in various aspects of our life. However, recent software development practices have substantial negative impacts (direct and indirect) on economy, society, human beings, and environment. To cope with these issues the concept of Green Software Engineering has boomed recently. Green and sustainable software development aims to create green software that meets the needs of current and future users while minimizing its negative impacts on the environment and society. Green software development is getting attention in Global Software Engineering (GSE). Software development multi-sourcing vendor organizations have focused on the adaptation of green practices in software development projects. The objectives of this study are to identify and scrutinize a list of critical success factors (CSFs) for vendors in the development of green and sustainable software. The required data for conducting the study was taken, via systematic literature review (SLR) process, from a sample of 74 research papers. The SLR findings reveal that 'green software design and efficient coding', 'power­ saving software strategies', 'low carbon emission throughout the software development process', 'efficient resource utilization', 'paperless communication', 'filtration of requirements through green evaluator and e-waste management' are the critical factors to be implanted by vendors in the development of green and sustainable software.

Título: Does Project Associated Situational Factors have Impact on Sustainability of Modern Code Review Workforce?
Resumo: Code review is an essential practice to evaluate the quality of source code. Presently the Modern trend of code review known as Modern Code Review (MCR), an informal modified version of Fagan’s inspection is widely used. In MCR process, MCR workforce that is author and reviewer work together to improve the code quality and software quality. It is a peer-reviewed process, the source code written by the author is evaluated by the reviewer. For the effective outcomes of the MCR process, it is required to focus on the sustainability of the MCR workforce so that they can sustain for a longer and produce the effective outcomes. However, the sustainability of MCR workforce is impacted by the unidentified project-related situational factors. The existing literature of MCR is lacking concerning the identification of project-related situational factors that impact the sustainability of the MCR workforce. Therefore, this study aims to perform the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to identify the project-related situational factors that can impact the sustainability of the MCR workforce. The situational components are collected into two key classifications, for example, project release management and project attributes. The grounded hypothesis approach has been applied to get final unique and categorized list of project-related situational factors. The identified unique and categorized list of project-related situational components is additionally double checked by the expert panel for their categorizations, naming conventions and suggestions of additional project-related situational factors. The investigation results announced 18 project-related situational factors. The study will be advantageous for experts involved in situational software engineering research as well as the MCR workforce to sustain for longer by overcoming the challenge of unidentified situations.

Título: Empirical studies on the use of social software in global software development-A systematic mapping study
Resumo: Background: In Global Software Development (GSD), informal communication and knowledge sharing play an important role. Social Software (SoSo) has the potential to support and foster this key responsibility. Research on the use of SoSo in GSD is still at an early stage: although a number of empirical studies on the usage of SoSo are available in related fields, there exists no comprehensive overview of what has been investigated to date across them. Objective The aim of this review is to map empirical studies on the usage of SoSo in Software Engineering projects and in distributed teams, and to highlight the findings of research works which could prove to be beneficial for GSD researchers and practitioners. Method A Systematic Mapping Study is conducted using a broad search string that allows identifying a variety of studies which can be beneficial for GSD. Papers have been retrieved through a combination of automatic search and snowballing, hence a wide quantitative map of the research area is provided. Additionally, text extracts from the studies are qualitatively synthesised to investigate benefits and challenges of the use of SoSo. Results SoSo is reported as being chiefly used as a support for collaborative work, fostering awareness, knowledge management and coordination among team members. Contrary to the evident high importance of the social aspects offered by SoSo, socialisation is not the most important usage reported. Conclusions This review reports how SoSo is used in GSD and how it is capable of supporting GSD teams. Four emerging themes in global software engineering were identified: the appropriation and development of usage structures; understanding how an ecology of communication channels and tools are used by teams; the role played by SoSo either as a subtext or as an explicit goal; and finally, the surprising low percentage of observational studies. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Título: Environmental sustainability in software process improvement: A systematic mapping study
Resumo: Sustainability is a main concern in our current society. One of the aspects that play an important role in supporting sustainable development is Information Technology (IT). Both software behavior and the way it is developed impact the amount of energy consumption. Thus, this paper aims to present the most recent approaches to address sustainability from a software process improvement perspective. A systematic mapping study was conducted to identify the latest efforts made in the IT field to improve sustainability. As a result, seven primary papers with initial ideas about how sustainability can be integrated into software processes were found. The lack of both proposals and empirical data suggests that further research on the topic is needed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

Título: Exploring the software quality criteria and sustainable development targets: A case study of digital library in malaysian higher learning institution
Resumo: Being sustainable within social, environmental, and the economy is still a major issue to almost every company globally. Although on-going actions have been implemented via information and communication technology (ICT), studies and development efforts in seeking solutions are in scarcity, particularly for the present use of software to perform its intended task. The lack of technological innovation and development motivate us to explore the present use of software with the focus on software quality criteria (SQC) in attaining sustainable development targets (SDTs). The understanding of SQC is significant for the purpose of meeting the needs and operating environment of software that are continually changed in the future. This paper presents a semi-structured interview involving eight digital library’s stakeholders in one of Malaysian higher learning institution. By applying thematic analysis, the study finds six digital library software quality criteria (DL-SQC) and seven digital library sustainable development targets (DL-SDTs) that were heavily stressed by more than half of participants. The DL-SQC are usability, maintainability, functionality, portability, efficiency, and reliability. While the DL-SDTs are equal access to information/knowledge, energy efficiency, persistent updates the information/knowledge, collaboration & partnership, funding, green technology innovation, and information/knowledge sharing. The study contributes as a guide to researchers who are motivated to position their further studies into this topic and for a practitioner; it is to summarize the SQC and their relevant SDTs that may be applied to make decisions regarding the next level of software development and maintenance process towards being sustainable. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

Título: Flipped Classroom in Software Engineering: A Systematic Mapping Study
Resumo: Context. Software Engineering (SE) teaching is evolving continually, with new methods being developed and evaluated. In this sense, it is important to gain more knowledge of how such methods are actually implemented. Objective. The aim of this study is to systematically examine the literature on the use of the flipped classroom method in SE teaching. Method. To achieve the study objective, we conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) starting with 769 studies. After the filtering process, we extracted data from 26 primaries studies, which meet the study selection criteria. Results. We found papers from 2008 to 2020, most of them published in SE conferences. In fifteen papers, the content is delivered to the students before class, nine of them using a specific system developed to this task. We found that the in-class activities follow three main strategies: (1) project-based learning (38.3%); (2) problem-based learning and self-direct learning (50.0%); and (3) team-based learning (7.7%). Reviewed studies reported challenges in implementing FC in ES course such as overworked and time-constrained professors and difficulty in sustaining student motivation. Also, we found studies reporting improvements in student learning and motivation Conclusion. Based on our findings, we conclude the use of an active method has proved to be useful for in-class practical activities, especially related to the software development field. We also observed that adaptive educational content delivery has not been explored in software engineering studies with flipped classes.

Título: Framework for Effective Utilization of Distributed Scrum in Software Projects
Resumo: There is an emerging interest in using agile methodologies in Global Software Development (GSD) to get the mutual benefits of both methods. Scrum is currently admired by many development teams as an agile most known methodology and considered adequate for collocated teams. At the same time, stakeholders in GSD are dispersed by geographical, temporal, and socio-cultural distances. Due to the controversial nature of Scrum and GSD, many significant challenges arise that might restrict the use of Scrum in GSD. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) by following Kitchenham guidelines to identify the challenges that limit the use of Scrum in GSD and to explore the mitigation strategies adopted by practitioners to resolve the challenges. To validate our review findings, we conducted an industrial survey of 305 practitioners. The results of our study are consolidated into a research framework. The framework represents current best practices and recommendations to mitigate the identified distributed scrum challenges and is validated by five experts of distributed Scrum. Results of the expert review were found supportive, reflecting that the framework will help the stakeholders deliver sustainable products by effectively mitigating the identified challenges. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

Título: Ghgfarm - A software tool to estimate and reduce net-greenhouse gas emission from farms in Canada
Resumo: Decision support software tools and computer simulation models help us to better understand the structure and functioning of agricultural ecosystems - how to better manage them in a sustainable way. They assist in the synthesis of interdisciplinary knowledge amongst stake-holders, automation of meta-analyses, communication and outreach. In this paper, we showcase the GHGFarm software tool for estimating and reducing net-greenhouse gas emission from farms. This software tool provides a capability for scientists, policy makers, and agricultural producers to collectively quantify, interpret and compare alternative farm management scenarios, thereby encouraging the adoption of longer-term sustainable farm practices. Farmers can characterize their multi-enterprise operations and management practices in a flexible way. Reduction scenarios are generated from current scientific knowledge and emission algorithms available (International Panel on Climate Change, IPCC), modified with Canadian-specific emission factors, local practices, topography, and climate conditions. We discuss the software development approach, highlighting past and present challenges within the broader context of empirical software engineering and agricultural extension. We identify the need for a better resolved multi-user stream/flow design, enhancement of the graphical user interface, expanded sensitivity testing and quantification of uncertainty.

Título: Green and Sustainable Software Engineering - a Systematic Mapping Study
Resumo: Understanding how the concepts of sustainability could be incorporated to the Software Engineering (SE) concepts has gained increased attention in the last years, particularly in terms of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Several studies have addressed the impact of sustainability in the SE practice, from a range of perspectives. This study presents a systematic mapping study that aggregates, summarizes and discusses the state-of-theart approaches for sustainable SE practice. We analyzed 75 relevant primary studies addressing methods, processes, tools and metrics proposed to support the software development in a sustainable way. The included primary studies were selected using inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to studies published prior to 2017. They were analyzed based on a set of classification criteria, including contribution types, SDLC phases, evidence types, research types, application domains, publication venues, distribution between academia and industry and research methods. The results indicated a growing interest by the SE research community in the Green and Sustainable software domain. Besides, there is an observed need for more studies on techniques, tools and metrics covering construction, testing and maintenance. The results also point out a clear view of the SE community about the need for a better alignment between research and practice in this domain.

Título: Green-Agile Maturity Model: An Evaluation Framework for Global Software Development Vendors
Resumo: Agile methods are extensively adapted by software development organizations due to the competitive beneﬁts it offers. In recent years global software development (GSD) projects practice agile methods as prominent methods to deliver the software in increments with utmost user satisfaction and affordable cost. Beside the use of agile methods, the software industry has also considered the green aspect of software, to be in line with the demands of the organizations and the world technological ecosystem. The green and sustainable feature of software should focus both the energy and resource efﬁciency key factors. This phenomenon of embedding the green ﬂavor in software has emerged a new research area, green software engineering, that promises the development of eco-friendly software with minimum energy and use of less computing resources, to trim down the adverse effects on both society and environment. The principal objective of this research study is to design and develop a multi-level Green-Agile Maturity Model (GAMM) to assess the GSD vendors’ agile maturity in terms of green software development. The model has been built in four phases. In phase I and II, systematic literature review (SLR) was performed to identify the success factors and risk factors that either supports or hinders the green and sustainable software development respectively by practicing the agile methods in GSD. The results have been validated from 106 relevant experts, dealing with agile and green software projects, through questionnaire survey. The experts’ demographic represents 25 different countries. We also identiﬁed the industry practices through SLR and survey, to address our identiﬁed critical factors. Phase III of this research deals with development of the GAMM by categorizing the identiﬁed factors into seven Green-Agile maturity levels. A similar approach has been used in other models such as Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI), Implementation Maturity Model (IMM) and Software Outsourcing Vendors Readiness Model (SOVRM). In phase IV of this research, ﬁve case studies were conducted at GSD organizations, to evaluate the structure and efﬁcacy of the GAMM, while as a major contribution, this paper presents our developed model, the GAMM, which aims to assess the green-agile maturity of the GSD vendors in terms of green and sustainable software development.

Título: Greta thunberg and the generation of moral authority: A systematic literature review on the characteristics of thunberg’s leadership
Resumo: Numerous efforts have been made by political leaders worldwide to prevent further climate change and develop sustainable solutions. However, due to conflicting political positions and the complex solutions required, attempts to limit climate change have proven largely ineffective. For these reasons, a new kind of environmental change leader is needed to catalyze significant societal transformation. In recent years, Greta Thunberg has become a major spokesperson for environmental issues, mobilizing people worldwide to act against climate change. Utilizing a theoretical framework based on transformational leadership and moral authority, this article discusses, by means of a systematic literature review, the characteristics of Thunberg’s leadership. Using the PRISMA protocol, data were collected from various national and international media sources. With the assistance of ATLAS‐ti.v.9 Scientific Software Development GmbH, Berlin, Germany, qualitative deductive content analysis was performed to analyze the data. In this review, we discuss how Thunberg embodies five characteristics that are typical of moral authority, thereby becoming a transformational leader who influences the possibility of preventing climate change and promotes more sustainable solutions. This article concludes that it is through the characteristics of moral authority that Greta Thunberg has become a global transformational leader for those defending the natural environment. © 2021 by the authors.

Título: Human sustainability in software development
Resumo: Human thriving and outsourcing can go hand in hand. This research aims to outline outsourcing approaches for facilitating human thriving by conducting a semi-systematic literature review. We identified three outsourcing approaches that consider corporate social responsibility: impact sourcing, ethical outsourcing, and Fair Trade Software. The aim of this research is to understand the effect of these approaches on marginalized people, and the benefits and challenges for client organizations. The following main conclusions are drawn. First, impact sourcing provides marginalized people with the opportunity to generate an income, to develop themselves professionally, and to build a social circle. In some cases it can generate harmful impacts such as stress. Second, the benefits of impact sourcing for client organizations compared to traditional outsourcing are reduced costs, reduced employee turnover, improved corporate social responsibility, and new chances for growth. Third, ethical outsourcing protects brand image and can improve stakeholder management. However, the extra investments required may reduce competitiveness. Last, Fair Trade Software is a relatively new model, and therefore the benefits and challenges have yet to be assessed. A potential benefit is capacity building by knowledge transfer and network strengthening. Currently some of the biggest challenges are the lack of audits, caused by a lack of resources, and increasing the adoption rate of this outsourcing model. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

Título: Indicators for green in IT audits: A systematic mapping study
Resumo: In recent years the world has been experiencing a series of environmental changes that have led to the emergence of a strong conviction in society to do with the need to protect the environment. Information Technologies (IT), especially software technologies, can contribute to environmental sustainability in two ways: "Green by IT", in the sense that IT can provide tools to perform tasks in a way that is suitable for the environment, and "Green in IT", when ITs themselves have an impact on the environment, due to their energy consumption. However, the techniques of Green in IT are relatively young, and there is no standard or framework to control their correct implementation and/or operation. The objective of this systematic mapping study is therefore to collect the current knowledge about Green in IT audits, in order to determine what are the most important characteristics in the development of an audit framework for Green in IT and especially the indicators used for this auditing. The results obtained demonstrate the novelty of this area, as well as the almost complete absence of studies related to the topic. All of this points to the need to develop a framework for Green in IT auditing.

Título: Individual Sustainability Barriers and Mitigation Strategies: Systematic Literature Review Protocol
Resumo: Software engineering supports the development of software systems ensuring ease and success for humanity. However, humanity is facing various complex barriers contributing risk to societies, for instance, lack of sustainable software engineering practices, tools, and methodologies. As a software engineer, one can support and contribute to sustainability by developing sustainable software products through sustainable practices along with managing economic, environmental, social, technical and individual dimensions of sustainability. Software engineering with sustainable practices allows for the development of sustainable software. Sustainability concerning economic, environmental, technical and social dimensions have been well explored in literature but individual sustainability dimensions need insight from researchers. Therefore, there is a need to research from an individual sustainability perspective, so this study presents the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol to identify the individual sustainability barriers along with their mitigation strategies. This research will be helpful for a sustainable software engineering body of knowledge and researchers interested to contribute for sustainability concerns in software engineering, by providing the SLR protocol to identify the prioritized list of barriers and mitigation strategies concerning individual sustainability.

Título: Information technology outsourcing chain: Literature review and implications for development of distributed coordination
Resumo: The paper aims to analyse how the management science literature explains sustainable coordination and management of Information Technology (IT) outsourcing chains. The IT outsourcing theories,-that is, transaction cost theory, theory of agency, resource based view, activity based theory, contractual theory, partnership and alliance theory and stakeholder theory-are applied as a background to the analysis. A systematic literature review reveals that IT outsourcing is developed in collaborative networks and chains. There are some mechanisms identified in the literature for outsourcing chains' management, interchain sustainability, coordination and interchain activities' cohesion. The complexity of outsourcing relationships presented among outsourcers and outsourcees stimulate looking for new business models. Furthermore, outsourcing chains research would benefit from considering strategy-based theoretical discussions, relationship modelling and project management. The literature survey aims to present outsourcing chains in different aspects, that is, dynamics and agility, communication in chains, compensation and compliance, contracting, stakeholders, decision making models, governance problems, integration, performance measurement, project management and strategy development. This paper intends to emphasize that interchain coordination can be improved by enterprise architecture modelling as well as by the application of blockchain economy. © 2019 by the authors.

Título: Knowledge sharing, a key sustainable practice is on risk: An insight from Modern Code Review
Resumo: Knowledge is the foremost asset to succeed in the area of green sustainable software engineering. Effective knowledge sharing is a crucial objective of companies. However, individuals are not motivated to share knowledge. This study explores knowledge sharing in the context of Modern Code Review (MCR) where engineers assess source code composed by other developers to improve the product quality through knowledge exchange among developers (Author and reviewer). The procedure is profoundly subject to individual associations among developers regarding contribute to the outcomes of MCR such as identifying alternative solutions, code improvement, and knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing is supposed as an important outcome of MCR; however, developers involved in MCR activities are confronted with a lack of knowledge sharing challenge due to a dearth of knowledge sharing motivation. There are different individual factors that might encourage or hinder developers to engage in knowledge sharing. Studies have been performed dependent on information investigation gathered from surveys, interviews and review tools concerning elements affecting MCR, still the literature lacks research regarding factors impacting knowledge sharing aspect in MCR. Hence, this examination performs a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that distinguish individual factors impacting knowledge sharing in MCR. The examination discoveries 34 individual factors such as biasness, cognitive load, time pressure, expertise, etc. The factors are grouped into 7 broad categories utilizing grounded theory. Study discoveries have suggestions for programming specialists involved in MCR activities and researchers interested to perform research in this area to broaden the examination and perform MCR exercises adequately by considering and beating the negative effect of recognized variables.

Título: Modeling crop genetic resources phenotyping information systems
Resumo: Documentation of phenotype information is a priority need in biodiversity, crop modeling, breeding, ecology, and evolution research, for association studies, gene discovery, retrospective statistical analysis and data mining, QTL re-mapping, choosing cultivars, and planning crosses. Lack of access to phenotype information is still seen as a limiting factor for the use of plant genetic resources. Phenotype data are complex. Information on the context, under which they were collected, is indispensable, and the domain is continuously evolving. This study describes comprehensive data and object models supporting web interfaces for multi-site field phenotyping and data acquisition, which have been developed for Central Crop Databases within the European Cooperative Programme for Plant Genetic Resources over the years and which can be used as blueprints for phenotyping information systems. We start from the hypothesis, that entity relationship and object models useful for software development can picture domain expertise, similar as domain ontologies, and encourage a discussion of scientific information systems on modeling level. Starting from information requirements for statistical analysis, meta-analysis, and knowledge discovery, models are discussed in consideration of several standardization and modeling approaches including crop ontologies. Following an object-oriented modeling approach, we keep data and object models close together and to domain concepts. This will make database and software design better understandable and usable for domain experts and support a modular use of software artifacts to be shared across various domains of expertise. Classes and entities represent domain concepts with attributes naturally assigned to them. Field experiments with randomized plots, as typically used in the evaluation of plant genetic resources and in plant breeding, are in the focus. Phenotype observations, which can be listed as raw or aggregated data, are linked to explanatory metadata describing experimental treatments and agronomic interventions, observed traits and observation methodology, field plan and plot design, and the experiment site as a geographical entity. Based on clearly defined types, potential links to information systems in other domains (e.g., geographic information systems) can be better identified. Work flows are shown as web applications for the generation of field plans, field books, templates, upload of spreadsheet data, and images. © 2019 Germeier and Unger.

Título: Models@run.time: a guided tour of the state of the art and research challenges
Resumo: More than a decade ago, the research topic models@run.time was coined. Since then, the research area has received increasing attention. Given the prolific results during these years, the current outcomes need to be sorted and classified. Furthermore, many gaps need to be categorized in order to further develop the research topic by experts of the research area but also newcomers. Accordingly, the paper discusses the principles and requirements of models@run.time and the state of the art of the research line. To make the discussion more concrete, a taxonomy is defined and used to compare the main approaches and research outcomes in the area during the last decade and including ancestor research initiatives. We identified and classified 275 papers on models@run.time, which allowed us to identify the underlying research gaps and to elaborate on the corresponding research challenges. Finally, we also facilitate sustainability of the survey over time by offering tool support to add, correct and visualize data. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Título: Practices for addressing environmental sustainability through requirements processes
Resumo: Requirements activities performed in a software project are fundamental to address sustainable software systems and products. Although several techniques and frameworks have been proposed to describe sustainability requirements, there is a lack of process support for incorporating them in requirements centered processes. The objective of this paper is to understand the extent to which proposals to develop sustainability requirements can be mapped with the activities and tasks of the requirements processes that are part of ISO/IEC 12207. The set of reviewed papers, extracted from a previous systematic mapping study, was classified with respect to processes tasks. As a result, reviewed papers showed a trend to address tasks from the stakeholder requirements definition process, such as stakeholder identification, elicitation of requirements, and requirements analysis. However, activities and tasks within both the system requirements analysis process and software requirements analysis process need methodological support. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

Título: Practices of Energy Consumption for Sustainable Software Engineering
Resumo: Sustainable Software Engineering, also known as “Green IN Software”, focuses on the production of sustainable software. The traditional software engineering process causes negative influences on the environment, economy and to society. For instance, the energy consumption during the software processing is considered as a first order impact because it directly leads to high costs on energy bills and consequently on the environment. Moreover, the optimization of a process implementation and software development can lead to second order impacts, also referred to as indirect impacts. Finally, the third other impact considers the user’s behaviors and consciousness regarding the concept of sustainability. In order to mitigate these negative impacts, the purpose of this research is to identify, via systematic literature review, the practices of sustainable software engineering reported by the academy applied in the industry. Through the systematic literature review, it was possible to discover 170 practices in which 70 were related to practices of energy consumption that could be adopted during the software development. Our results indicate that those practices emerged from the grounded theory, which are part of SWEBOK areas and are applicable in the industry.

Título: Predictive maintenance using digital twins: A systematic literature review
Resumo: Context: Predictive maintenance is a technique for creating a more sustainable, safe, and profitable industry. One of the key challenges for creating predictive maintenance systems is the lack of failure data, as the machine is frequently repaired before failure. Digital Twins provide a real-time representation of the physical machine and generate data, such as asset degradation, which the predictive maintenance algorithm can use. Since 2018, scientific literature on the utilization of Digital Twins for predictive maintenance has accelerated, indicating the need for a thorough review. Objective: This research aims to gather and synthesize the studies that focus on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins to pave the way for further research. Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) using an active learning tool is conducted on published primary studies on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, in which 42 primary studies have been analyzed. Results: This SLR identifies several aspects of predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, including the objectives, application domains, Digital Twin platforms, Digital Twin representation types, approaches, abstraction levels, design patterns, communication protocols, twinning parameters, and challenges and solution directions. These results contribute to a Software Engineering approach for developing predictive maintenance using Digital Twins in academics and the industry. Conclusion: This study is the first SLR in predictive maintenance using Digital Twins. We answer key questions for designing a successful predictive maintenance model leveraging Digital Twins. We found that to this day, computational burden, data variety, and complexity of models, assets, or components are the key challenges in designing these models. © 2022

Título: Project portfolio management in small context in software industry: A systematic literature review
Resumo: In recent years, the software industry in Latin America, mostly consisted of small companies, has shown a notable increase in its operations. However, the practices they use do not allow them to achieve sustainable growth over time. In particular, one aspect that stands out is the disorder that presents inside the company when managing multiple projects with a very small human team. This paper seeks to identify experiences of application of models related to portfolio management in small contexts in the software industry. The study is carried out through a systematic literature review in relevant digital repositories. We have found 60 primary studies obtained in the search in the considered databases. Primary studies show that project portfolio management models present difficulties in their adoption in small contexts. In addition, there are few studies that refer to experiences of application of portfolio management models in small context in the software industry and point out that a relevant aspect for non-adoption is the lack of understanding of the models in their original proposal. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

Título: Refactoring business process models: A systematic review
Resumo: Business processes are nowadays recognized as one of the intangible business assets that provide more competitive advantage to organizations. Organizations must therefore be able to manage their business process models and deal with their quality problems, i.e. lack of understandability, maintainability or reusability among others. Such quality problems are exacerbated in business processes models that were mined by reverse engineering from enterprise information systems, since business process are more likely to undergo inconsistencies, redundancies, etc. Refactoring has proved to be a suitable solution to cope with these quality problems. Refactoring changes the internal structure of a business process model while preserves its external behaviour. This paper presents an in-depth systematic review for collecting, categorizing and analyzing all the refactoring methods and techniques applied to business process models. The systematic review is conducted following the formal methodology proposed by Kitchenhan. The review reports 206 related studies, from which 16 were considered as primary studies. The most valuable conclusion is that none of these studies proposes refactoring techniques for business process models previously obtained by reverse engineering, which is considered as a greenfield research area.

Título: Requirements engineering for sustainable software systems: a systematic mapping study
Resumo: Various approaches toward the development of sustainable software systems have been proposed by the requirements engineering community over the last decade. We conducted a systematic mapping study, analyzed 55 publications, and identified 29 approaches that have been published since the year 2000. We analyzed how the approaches evolved over time and how the publications and authors are influenced by each other. Furthermore, the approaches are analyzed in terms of their supported requirements engineering activities, along with the evidence provided in the publications. Additionally, we also analyzed which sustainability definitions have been used, if an iterative application of the approaches is discussed, and if the approaches also provide a tool-support for practitioners. We noticed an increase of publications on requirements engineering approaches toward sustainability in the last years, whereas a majority discuss sustainability based on the same multi-dimensional concept. Although different case studies have been already conducted, we noticed a lack of an industrial application. Our main findings concern the need of an evaluation on how the proposed requirements engineering approaches can also be applied in agile software development processes. Additionally, we also promote the development of supporting software tools to support practitioners in adapting the proposed approaches.

Título: Risks mitigation practices for multi-sourcing vendors in green software development
Resumo: Green and sustainable software development is the cry of the day and vendors are constantly striving to develop such software that have less hazardous impact on environment, economy and human beings. However developing green software in the context of software multi-sourcing is not a risk free activity. Software development multi-sourcing vendor organizations have focused on the adaptation of green practices in software development projects. In our previous study we have identified eight critical risk factors (CRFs) via systematic literature review (SLR) process, in the development of green and sustainable software. These CRFs are: ‘lack of green RE practices’, ‘high power consumption’, ‘high carbon emission throughout the software development’, ‘poor software design (architectural, logical, physical and user interface)’, ‘lack of ICTs for coordination and communication’, ‘high resources requirements’, ‘lack of coding standards’, and ‘lack of green software development knowledge’. The proactive management of the identified risks might allow software development multi-sourcing vendor organizations to develop green and sustainable software successfully. In this study we have presented the identified 76 practices for addressing the aforementioned eight critical risk factors. The practices were extracted from sample of (N=102) research papers via SLR process. We have validated the identified 76 solutions/practices from 108 relevant experts in software development multi-sourcing industry via questionnaire survey. The findings of this study may help vendor organizations to address/mitigate the CRFs using the identified solutions in order to develop green and sustainable software in multi-sourced software projects. © Pakistan Academy of Sciences.

Título: Scientific mapping to identify competencies required by industry 4.0
Resumo: The objective of this study was to identify what competencies are identified in the literature as necessary for Industry 4.0 by conducting a survey of the literature and a scientific mapping of the evolution of the issues related to the qualification of professionals for Industry 4.0 and possible paths for research and education. A search was conducted on the Scopus, Web of Science and Science Direct databases for the interval from 2010 to 2018. This systematic review revealed topics and authors currently specialized in the field and allowed mapping the field of study. The identification of journals and keywords useful in future studies was also an object of this study. SciMAT software was used for the systematic literature review. The results are highlighted by the set of competencies (knowledge and skills) that must be developed in professional education to accompany the new industrial revolution, as well as the importance of integrating efforts by companies, governments and universities. These efforts should focus on creating “learning factories”, which are understood to be environments that provide practical experiences to these professionals, preparing them in the best way possible for the requirements of Industry 4.0. This conceptual map showed that the main competencies needed include skills: (leadership, strategic vision of knowledge, self-organization, giving and receiving feedback, pro-activity, creativity, problem solving, interdisciplinarity, teamwork, collaborative work, initiative, communication, innovation, adaptability, flexibility and self-management) and knowledge of contemporary fields (information and communication technology, algorithms, automation, software development and security, data analysis, general systems theory and sustainable development theory). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

Título: Situational factors affecting Software Engineers Sustainability: A Vision of Modern Code Review
Resumo: Code review is a sustainable software engineering practice to assure software quality. Presently it is performed by software engineers with the help of tool support, for instance, Gerrit and termed as Modern Code Review (MCR). It is a lightweight way to deal with distinguishing abandons from source code. Software engineer’s efficiency while performing MCR activities is exposed to varying people related situational factors that impact the software engineer’s sustainability. The literature lacks the identification of people related situational factors in MCR. For successful MCR results, there is a need to distinguish people concerning situational factors to enhance the productivity and competence of software engineers for their sustainability. Therefore, this investigation intends to recognize situational variables influencing the ability and efficiency of software engineers. The systematic methodology utilized for this examination is Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The study results reported 52 situational factors. The situational factors are assembled into four fundamental classifications such as team, team interaction, reviewer response and knowledge sharing. The grounded theory approach has been applied to get final unique list of people related situational factors and sub factors. The investigation will be useful for expert performing examination seeing situational factors as well as the sustainability of software engineers engaged with MCR activities.

Título: Situational factors for modern code review to support software engineers' sustainability
Resumo: Software engineers working in Modern Code Review (MCR) are confronted with the issue of lack of competency in the identification of situational factors. MCR is a software engineering activity for the identification and fixation of defects before the delivery of the software product. This issue can be a threat to the individual sustainability of software engineers and it can be addressed by situational awareness. Therefore, the objective of the study is to identify situational factors concerning the MCR process. Systematic Literature Review (SLR) has been used to identify situational factors. Data coding along with continuous comparison and memoing procedures of grounded theory and expert review has been used to produce an exclusive and validated list of situational factors grouped under categories. The study results conveyed 23 situational factors that are grouped into 5 broad categories i.e. People, Organization, Technology, Source Code and Project. The study is valuable for researchers to extend the research and for software engineers to identify situations and sustain for longer. © 2013 The Science and Information (SAI) Organization.

Título: Software architecture for mobile cloud computing systems
Resumo: Mobile cloud computing (MCC) has recently emerged as a state-of-the-art technology for mobile systems. MCC enables portable and context-aware computation via mobile devices by exploiting virtually unlimited hardware and software resources offered by cloud computing servers. Software architecture helps to abstract the complexities of system design, development, and evolution phases to implement MCC systems effectively and efficiently. This paper aims to identify, taxonomically classify, and systematically map the state of the art on architecting MCC-based software. We have used an evidence-based software engineering (EBSE) approach to conduct a systematic mapping study (SMS) based on 121 qualitatively selected research studies published from 2006 to 2019. The results of the SMS highlight that architectural solutions for MCC systems are mainly focused on supporting (i) software as a service for mobile computing, (ii) off-loading mobile device data to cloud-servers, (iii) internet of things, edge, and fog computing along with various aspects like (iv) security and privacy of mobile device data. The emerging research focuses on the existing and futuristic challenges that relate to MCC-based internet of things (IoTs), mobile-cloud edge systems, along with green and energy-efficient computing. The results of the SMS facilitate knowledge transfer that could benefit researchers and practitioners to understand the role of software architecture to develop the next generation of mobile-cloud systems to support internet-driven computing. © 2019 by the authors.

Título: Software component decision-making: In-house, OSS, COTS or outsourcing - A systematic literature review
Resumo: Context: Component-based software systems require decisions on component origins for acquiring components. A component origin is an alternative of where to get a component from. Objective: To identify factors that could influence the decision to choose among different component origins and solutions for decision-making (For example, optimization) in the literature. Method: A systematic review study of peer-reviewed literature has been conducted. Results: In total we included 24 primary studies. The component origins compared were mainly focused on in-house vs. COTS and COTS vs. OSS. We identified 11 factors affecting or influencing the decision to select a component origin. When component origins were compared, there was little evidence on the relative (either positive or negative) effect of a component origin on the factor. Most of the solutions were proposed for in-house vs. COTS selection and time, cost and reliability were the most considered factors in the solutions. Optimization models were the most commonly proposed technique used in the solutions. Conclusion: The topic of choosing component origins is a green field for research, and in great need of empirical comparisons between the component origins, as well of how to decide between different combinations of them. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Título: Software Sustainability in Customer-Driven Courses
Resumo: Context: Software sustainability is an emergent topic in an age when software is becoming ever more ubiquitous. We, as researchers, have the responsibility of ensuring the dissemination of sustainable software developments in the industry and academic contexts before enacting the creation of a body of knowledge in software sustainability. Our paper presents a review of project descriptions from a project-based course designed in close collaboration with students and external customers. Our master’s course is based on four decades of software engineering experience and teaching at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. In the scope of this work, we analyzed 45 customers’ project proposals over the past three years to identify the social and technical sustainability addressed by the proposals. Objectives: More precisely, we investigated 1) how software social sustainability topics are introduced from customers’ project descriptions, 2) how software technical sustainability is addressed from customers’ project descriptions, and 3) the extent to which software environmental and economical sustainability is addressed from customers’ project descriptions. Method: We conducted a deductive thematic analysis utilizing open coding of customers’ project descriptions. Results: We found that customers’ project descriptions moderately addressed social sustainability for specific target groups. Technical sustainability is also addressed by a little more than half of the overall projects. However, we observed that no effort was made to address environmental and economic sustainability. Contribution: The study’s overall findings contribute to the future improvement of the course and help inform customers about prospective socially relevant project proposals.

Título: Sustainability in Software Architecture: A Systematic Mapping Study
Resumo: Sustainability is an increasingly-studied topic in software engineering in general, and in software architecture in particular. There are already a number of secondary studies addressing sustainability in software engineering, but no such study focusing explicitly on software architecture. This work aims to ﬁll this gap by conducting a systematic mapping study on the intersection between sustainability and software architecture research with the intention of (i) reﬂecting on the current state of the art, and (ii) identifying the needs for further research. Our results show that, overall, existing works have focused disproportionately on speciﬁc aspects of sustainability, and in particular on the most technical and “inward facing” ones. This comes at the expense of the holistic perspective required to address a multi-faceted concern such as sustainability. Furthermore, more reﬂection-oriented research works, and better coverage of the activities in the architecting life cycle are required to further the maturity of the area. Based on our ﬁndings we then propose a research agenda for sustainability-aware software architecture.

We assessed the 100 ﬁrst results of each database ordered by relevance with respect to the search query. Results: Of 500 classiﬁed publications, we regard 96 as relevant for our research questions. We sketch a taxonomy of their topics and domains, and provide lists of used methods and proposed approaches. Most of the excluded publications were ruled out because of an unﬁtting usage of terms within the search query. Conclusions: Currently, there is little research coverage on the different aspects of sustainability in software engineering while other disciplines are already more active. Future work includes extending the study by reviewing a higher number of publications, including dedicated journal and workshop searches, and snowballing.

Título: Sustainability is Stratified: Toward a Better Theory of Sustainable Software Engineering
Resumo: Background: Sustainable software engineering (SSE) means creating software in a way that meets present needs without undermining our collective capacity to meet our future needs. It is typically conceptualized as several intersecting dimensions or “pillars”—environmental, social, economic, technical and individual. However; these pillars are theoretically underdeveloped and require reﬁnement. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to generate a better theory of SSE. Method: First, a scoping review was conducted to understand the state of research on SSE and identify existing models thereof. Next, a meta-synthesis of qualitative research on SSE was conducted to critique and improve the existing models identiﬁed. Results: 961 potentially relevant articles were extracted from ﬁve article databases. These articles were de-duplicated and then screened independently by two screeners, leaving 243 articles to examine. Of these, 109 were non-empirical, the most common empirical method was systematic review, and no randomized controlled experiments were found. Most papers focus on ecological sustainability (158) and the sustainability of software products (148) rather than processes. A meta-synthesis of 36 qualitative studies produced several key propositions, most notably, that sustainability is stratiﬁed (has different meanings at different levels of abstraction) and multisystemic (emerges from interactions among multiple social, technical, and sociotechnical systems). Conclusion: The academic literature on SSE is surprisingly non-empirical. More empirical evaluations of speciﬁc sustainability interventions are needed. The sustainability of software development products and processes should be conceptualized as multisystemic and stratiﬁed, and assessed accordingly.

Título: Sustainable software engineering - have we neglected the software engineer's perspective?
Resumo: Background: Software development is a knowledgeintensive and creative activity requiring human ingenuity, thus, sustainability from an engineer’s perspective (i.e., meeting an engineer’s personal and professional needs while maintaining their mental and physical well-being) must be achieved and maintained. Aims: With this paper, we aim to bring attention to the currently overlooked aspect of sustainability from an individual engineer’s perspective. Method: Through an analysis of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies, this research demonstrates a lack of research investigating the individual (human) dimension of sustainability in the current software engineering literature. Results: The analysis of the literature reviews reveals that the current research has mainly focused on reducing the energy footprint of software systems. Thus, revealing the renewed need for paying attention to the individual engineer’s perspective. Conclusion: Future research should leverage contributions from related research areas like human aspects in software engineering (e.g., topics like cognition and motivation). There is a need for identifying factors that impact sustainability at an individual level and their interplay with the team and organization level practices, policies, and decisions. The overall ambition is to develop empirically validated guidelines and best practices to measure, improve and maintain sustainability from an engineer’s perspective. Such measures are expected to ensure engineers’ sustainability and enable highquality software development.

Título: Sustainable software engineering: A perspective of individual sustainability
Resumo: Sustainable software engineering is a mean of developing sustainable software with sustainable software engineering process activities while balancing its various dimensions for instance economic, environmental, social, technical and individual. It is conveyed that the economic, technical, environmental and social dimensions are explored to satisfactory degree however the individual dimension of sustainable software engineering which is concerned with wellbeing of software engineers is not explored to satisfactory degree with respect to its understanding and challenges. Therefore, the aim of the study is to highlight and prioritize the challenges regarding individual sustainability dimension. The study also provides the mitigation strategies for the top five individual sustainability challenges. The systematic literature review has been performed to report the challenges and mitigation strategies. The study finding shows that lack of domain knowledge, lack of methodologies and tool support, lack of education, varying and unidentified situations and lack of sustainable software engineering practices are top most challenges regarding individual sustainability. These challenges need an urgent attention to achieve the goal of sustainable software engineering.

Título: Sustained Agile Usage: A Systematic Literature Review
Resumo: Context: Agile methodologies (AM) emerged as a popular alternative to formalized methods, and have gained widespread acceptance in both the academic and industrial contexts. While most research has focused on their early stages of adoption and use, there is little evidence that agile methodologies have been effectively used beyond the adoption stage. Objective: The objective of this paper is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the various factors that impact the sustained usage of agile methods. Method: We performed a systematic literature review to identify empirical studies relating to agile usage. We followed the guidelines provided for conducting systematic literature reviews in software engineering [<u>1, 2</u>] using the following distinct stages: 1) protocol development and the search strategy, 2) exclusion process, 3) data extraction, and 4) data synthesis. Results: Our review identified nine critical factors viz., Management Support, Attitude, Motivation, Team Composition, Training, Agile Mindset, Technical Competence and Expertise, Agile Engineering Practices, and Methodology Champion. Conclusions: Our review highlights the significance of nine critical factors that impact sustained usage of AM in organizations. Our findings also indicate that the right balance and combination of various factors with an emphasis on continuous improvement will be crucial for achieving true agile sustainability in organizations.

Título: Systematic literature review protocol for green software multi-sourcing with preliminary results
Resumo: Green Software Engineering is a research area gaining reputation rapidly in order to create green software. Software development multi-sourcing is a modern Global Software Engineering (GSE) pattern for creating high quality software at minimum cost and time at low wages countries by contracting out the software development work to multiple vendors located at multiple geographical locations across the globe. Green Software multi-sourcing is a modern research area which lies at the intersection of both the aforementioned research areas (Green Software Engineering and Software Multi-Sourcing). The goal of this paper is to present the systematic literature review (SLR) protocol which has been developed, validated and in the process of implementation. The implementation of the SLR protocol will yield in the identification of success/risk factors, and real-world green practices to be considered by multi-sourcing vendor organizations that can contribute towards the development of green and sustainable software. Systematic Literature Review procedure has been used as research practice. SLR is a new research method in software engineering which is dissimilar from conventional literature analysis. SLR is more comprehensive and is grounded on a pre-defined protocol. We have developed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) protocol and are currently in the process of its implementation. The anticipated conclusions of the SLR execution will be the identification of success/risk factors and practices that can contribute towards the development of green software in multi-sourced projects. © Pakistan Academy of Sciences.

Título: Systematic literature reviews in agile software development: A tertiary study
Resumo: Context A number of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies (SLRs) covering numerous primary research studies on various aspects of agile software development (ASD) exist. Objective The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and practitioners. Method We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al. to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015. Results We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas: adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability, global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, embedded systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied standardized guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different contexts such as embedded systems. Conclusion SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can benefit from further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups, sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as a fresh review of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post 2008. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Título: Systematic mapping study on software engineering for sustainability (SE4S)
Resumo: Background/Context: The objective of achieving higher sustainability in our lifestyles by information and communication technology has lead to a plethora of research activities in related ﬁelds. Consequently, Software Engineering for Sustainability (SE4S) has developed as an active area of research. Objective/Aim: Though SE4S gained much attention over the past few years and has resulted in a number of contributions, there is only one rigorous survey of the ﬁeld. We follow up on this systematic mapping study from 2012 with a more in-depth overview of the status of research, as most work has been conducted in the last 4 years. Method : The applied method is a systematic mapping study through which we investigate which contributions were made, which knowledge areas are most explored, and which research type facets have been used, to distill a common understanding of the state-of-the-art in SE4S. Results: We contribute an overview of current research topics and trends, and their distribution according to the research type facet and the application domains. Furthermore, we aggregate the topics into clusters and list proposed and used methods, frameworks, and tools. Conclusion: The research map shows that impact currently is limited to few knowledge areas and there is need for a future roadmap to ﬁll the gaps.

Título: Systematic Review Checklist: A Standardized Technique for Assessing and Reporting Reviews of Life Cycle Assessment Data
Resumo: Systematic review, including meta-analysis, is increasingly utilized in life cycle assessment (LCA). There are currently no widely recognized guidelines for designing, conducting, or reporting systematic reviews in LCA. Other disciplines such as medicine, ecology, and software engineering have both recognized the utility of systematic reviews and created standardized protocols for conducting and reporting systematic reviews. Based largely on the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, which updated the preferred format for reporting of such reviews in biomedical research, we provide an introduction to the topic and a checklist to guide the reporting of future LCA reviews in a standardized format. The standardized technique for assessing and reporting reviews of LCA (STARR-LCA) is a starting point for improving the utility of systematic reviews in LCA. © 2012 by Yale University.

Título: Tool support for green android development: A systematic mapping study
Resumo: In order to make mobile apps energy efficient, we must find ways to support energy efficient app development. While there is a lack of support tools that aid practitioners in moving towards green Android development. Our goal is to establish the state of the art with respect to support tools that aid green Android development and to identify opportunities for further research. To achieve this goal, we conduct a systematic mapping study. After applying inclusion, exclusion and quality criteria we selected 21 studies for further analysis. Current support tools to aid green Android development were classified into three categories: Profiler, Detector and Optimizer. Most Profiler tools provide a graphical representation of energy consumed over time at various levels. Most Detector tools provide a list of energy bugs/code smells to be manually corrected by a developer for the improvement of energy. Most Optimizer tools automatically generate refactored version(s) of APK/SC. The most typical technique used by Detector and Optimizer tools is static source code analysis using a predefined set of rules. Profiler tools use a wide range of techniques to measure energy consumption. However, these tools have limitations in terms of code smell/energy bug coverage, accuracy, and usability.

Título: Towards a common understanding of sustainable software development
Resumo: The underlying principles of Sustainable Software Engineering are a core set of competencies Software Engineers need for defining, building, and running sustainable software applications. However, despite its importance, recently published studies have shown that Software Engineers have not reached a common and clear understanding of Sustainable Software Development (SSD). Consequently, it might be challenging to understand the value of the principles behind sustainability and how Software Engineers should apply them in practice. Therefore, the first step is to promote a field characterization to mitigate such effects to bridge such a gap. This paper reports on qualitative data analysis to leverage the sustainability principles through the support of the Grounded Theory method. We conducted this study using unstructured data retrieved from a systematic mapping study on sustainable software engineering and a survey applied in the software industry. To achieve the principles, we considered five critical dimensions: economic, social, individual, environmental, and technical. The key results are: (i) technical, environmental, and social concerns are present in all software development life-cycle (SDLC) phases; (ii) software engineers should consider sustainability requirements in the early SDLC phases; (iii) there is a need for stakeholder engagement focused on sustainability; (iv) software quality requirements support the development of sustainable software; and (v) sustainable concerns could generate trade-offs in the project. The yielded results might trigger further discussions around the SSD’s underlying principles and concepts and serve as a basis for the research community to identify models, techniques, and tools to support SSD.

Título: Towards developing collaborative experience based factory model for software development process in cloud computing environment
Resumo: Knowledge and experience are important assets for software organizations. In today’s global software development trends, development teams are no longer located in single premise; they are spreading across national and geographic boundaries. As a software project progresses, more and more activities are involved which results with the accumulation of knowledge and experiences. Maintaining and reusing of past experiences are vital; and it is even more crucial for distributed teams. In order to sustain in today’s competitive advantages, organizations should prepare a well collaborative solution for managing software development knowledge and experiences to maximize sharing and future reuse. Numerous attempts have been invested by researchers to overcome the issues on knowledge management in software development; however, the emphasis on the actual experiences collected throughout the development phases is limited. Furthermore, there are not many solutions offering comprehensive collaborative solution for managing software development experiences. In this paper, we propose a model for managing software development experiences including its tacit and explicit knowledge based on experience factory approach. The model is adapted for cloud computing environment with the goal to provide efficient and effective collaborative solution for knowledge access, sharing and reuse by capitalizing the cloud’s resources and infrastructure. A systematic literature review has been conducted to investigate the current issues of knowledge management in software development and to analyze available approaches and solutions. The findings are quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated to support the model formulation. © 2015 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.

Título: Towards Sustainability of Systematic Literature Reviews
Resumo: Background: The software engineering community has increasingly conducted systematic literature reviews (SLR) as a means to summarize evidence from different studies and bring to light the state of the art of a given research topic. While SLR provide many benefits, they also present several problems with punctual solutions for some of them. However, two main problems still remain: the high time-/effort-consumption nature of SLR and the lack of an effective impact of SLR results in the industry, as initially expected for SLR. Aims: The main goal of this paper is to introduce a new view — which we name Sustainability of SLR — on how to deal with SLR aiming at reducing those problems. Method: We analyzed six reference studies published in the last decade to identify, group, and analyze the SLR problems and their interconnections. Based on such analysis, we proposed the view of Sustainability of SLR that intends to address these problems. Results: The proposed view encompasses three dimensions (social, economic, and technical) that could become SLR more sustainable in the sense that the four major problems and 31 barriers (i.e., possible causes for those problems) that we identified could be mitigated. Conclusions: The view of Sustainability of SLR intends to change the researchers' mindset to mitigate the inherent SLR problems and, as a consequence, achieve sustainable SLR, i.e., those that consume less time/effort to be conducted and updated with useful results for the industry.

Título: Understanding software architecture erosion: A systematic mapping study
Resumo: Architecture erosion (AEr) can adversely affect software development and has received significant attention in the last decade. However, there is an absence of a comprehensive understanding of the state of research about the reasons and consequences of AEr, and the countermeasures to address AEr. This work aims at systematically investigating, identifying, and analyzing the reasons, consequences, and ways of detecting and handling AEr. With 73 studies included, the main results are as follows: (1) AEr manifests not only through architectural violations and structural issues but also causing problems in software quality and during software evolution; (2) non-technical reasons that cause AEr should receive the same attention as technical reasons, and practitioners should raise awareness of the grave consequences of AEr, thereby taking actions to tackle AEr-related issues; (3) a spectrum of approaches, tools, and measures has been proposed and employed to detect and tackle AEr; and (4) three categories of difficulties and five categories of lessons learned on tackling AEr were identified. The results can provide researchers a comprehensive understanding of AEr and help practitioners handle AEr and improve the sustainability of their architecture. More empirical studies are required to investigate the practices of detecting and addressing AEr in industrial settings. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Título: Using agile methods for the development of green and sustainable software: Success factors for GSD vendors
Resumo: Over the last decade, the use of agile methods has grown dramatically for software development. Agile methods guarantee to accelerate the delivery of remarkable software with increased user satisfaction and reduced cost. However, in recent years, due to the emergence of green software engineering, software developers are compelled to focus more on green and sustainable aspects of software. Green software engineering aims to design, develop, and use the software with confined energy and computing resources. Recently, software engineers in global software development have adapted agile methods for quick, interactive, and environment‐friendly software development.

Título: UX Research in the Software Industry: An Investigation of Long-Term UX Practices
Resumo: Software industry has sought to apply practices that provide a more meaningful User eXperience (UX) and help maintain a sustainable business. UX Research practices allows conducting research and evaluations with users from the application of methods and techniques. Some UX Research practices reveal longitudinal UX research actions (i.e., Long-Term UX) when they track products' use by users over time. The literature is scarce about studies that discuss the UX Research practices adopted by the software industry and their relationship with the different moments of product use (i.e., before, during, or after). Therefore, we surveyed the UX Research practices which are applied in software development in industry following the systematic literature review process. We selected 45 papers and conducted a qualitative analysis by applying coding techniques. As a result, we identify 38 practices which are classified into six categories, i.e. research planning, data collection with users, data analysis, design with research, organization and communication, and training for the research. Our findings show that 15 of 38 practices are related to Long-Term UX. We also identified the attitudes and needs of Long-Term UX experienced by the software industry.

Título: WeThinkCode_: Case Study of a Tuition-Free Coding Academy
Resumo: WeThinkCode_ is a tuition-free coding academy in Johannesburg that uses peer-to-peer learning methods. Launched in 2015, it positioned itself as a tertiary learning environment for anyone aged 17-35 looking to acquire digital skills. In South Africa, socio-economic circumstances for the majority of the population mean that their access to fees-based graduate training opportunities is limited. This is despite a significant undersupply of skilled software developers and many companies citing a lack of such skills as a strategic challenge. This mixed methods case study uses elementary statistical methods and thematic analysis to review elements of WeThinkCode_. Three transitions in the student journey are used as a high level framework to elicit insights about how the school works; (1) Applicant to Participant, (2) Participant to Learner and (3) Learner to Contributor.Applicant to Participant: The school attracts large numbers of economically disadvantaged individuals, filters them for programming affinity and inducts a manageable sized cohort into campus life. Participant to Learner: There is a well structured and continuously improving framework including life skills as well as core and elective modules over two years which facilitates the individual and collective learning process with strict performance measures. Learner to Contributor: Four month internship programmes in each year of study help students prepare for the workplace and build relationships with the corporates who sponsored their studies. The 2016 cohort has progressed through this student journey at WeThinkCode_ to become the first batch of workplace-ready programmers. Further work is also proposed including a socio-economic study of the contribution of the 2016 cohort and a comparison with relevant traditional tertiary education institutions covering costs, sustainability and student performance.

Título: What Makes Research Software Sustainable? An Interview Study with Research Software Engineers
Resumo: Software is now a vital scientiﬁc instrument, providing the tools for data collection and analysis across disciplines from bioinformatics and computational physics, to the humanities. The software used in research is often home-grown and bespoke: it is constructed for a particular project, and rarely maintained beyond this, leading to rapid decay, and frequent ‘reinvention of the wheel’. Understanding how to develop sustainable research software, such that it is suitable for future reuse, is therefore of interest to both researchers and funders, but how to achieve this remains an open question. Here we report the results of an interview study examining how research software engineers – the people actively developing software in an academic research environment – subjectively deﬁne software sustainability. Thematic analysis of the data reveals two interacting dimensions: intrinsic sustainability, which relates to internal qualities of software, such as modularity, encapsulation and testability, and extrinsic sustainability, concerning cultural and organisational factors, including how software is resourced, supported and shared. Research software engineers believe an increased focus on quality and discoverability are key factors in increasing the sustainability of academic research software.
