Título: A Collaborative Approach to Demand Side Energy Management
Resumo: Integrating the idea of collaborations into the energy domain appears a promising feat, although, relatively contemporary and uncommon. In this study, we implement a Demand Side Management strategy using the concept of Collaborative Virtual Power Plant Ecosystem as a digital representation of an Energy Community. The community uses a sharing platform to share experience, technical and professional knowledge, facilitating members ambition to change their energy use behaviours. Members of the community are represented as software agents. Behaviours in the adopted model are arranged in a framework of tasks and goals for agents to accomplish. Agents join the ecosystem under deterministic and stochastic conditions. A multi-method modelling approach is used. This study revealed that through collaboration, agents are able to accomplish set tasks faster, thus reducing their chances of frustration and subsequent exit from the ecosystem. This approach helps to influence member´s behaviour and increases membership fluidity, facilitating community stability and sustainability.

Título: A Comprehensive and Narrative Review of Industry 5.0 Technologies: 2018–2022
Resumo: The paper aims to classify and synthesize the findings of select articles on Industry 5.0 technologies in literature to provide insights and directions for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers. Forty-three papers were selected for review through systematic process and the technologies were categorized according to the three pillars of I 5.0, human-oriented, resilience-driven, and sustainability based. I 5.0 technologies are emerging across a vast section of industries but primarily automotive, manufacturing, supply chain operations, bio fuel generation, food, and healthcare waste recycling, transportation, power, and agriculture. SDG goals 7 and 9 have recent highest attention. The current technological ecosystem is more oriented towards systems/machines and less towards humans or sustainability. The human-centric aspect of technologies, systems, and services is not yet well developed. Human-centric systems are aimed to minimizing human intervention, enhancing human performance and productivity, and improving safety and comfort of humans engaged in the workplace. Conclusions and implications are drawn and future research directions identified.

Título: A comprehensive and systematic literature review on the big data management techniques in the internet of things
Resumo: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a communication paradigm and a collection of heterogeneous interconnected devices. It produces large-scale distributed, and diverse data called big data. Big Data Management (BDM) in IoT is used for knowledge discovery and intelligent decision-making and is one of the most significant research challenges today. There are several mechanisms and technologies for BDM in IoT. This paper aims to study the important mechanisms in this area systematically. This paper studies articles published between 2016 and August 2022. Initially, 751 articles were identified, but a paper selection process reduced the number of articles to 110 significant studies. Four categories to study BDM mechanisms in IoT include BDM processes, BDM architectures/frameworks, quality attributes, and big data analytics types. Also, this paper represents a detailed comparison of the mechanisms in each category. Finally, the development challenges and open issues of BDM in IoT are discussed. As a result, predictive analysis and classification methods are used in many articles. On the other hand, some quality attributes such as confidentiality, accessibility, and sustainability are less considered. Also, none of the articles use key-value databases for data storage. This study can help researchers develop more effective BDM in IoT methods in a complex environment.

Título: A Conceptual Design for Digital Industrial Symbiosis Ecosystems
Resumo: Conceptualizing, developing, and using digital platforms to support industrial symbiosis has gained momentum to facilitate sustainable industrial development. However, current research provides little insight and scarce guidance for the design of platform-supported industrial symbiosis. Furthermore, experiences and viewpoints of (potential) platform users and providers are hardly captured. Moreover, the actors’ roles and the suitability of platforms for different industrial symbiosis settings remain neglected. These aspects are relevant for providing, maintaining, continuously developing, accepting, and using the platforms themselves. Therefore, within a long-term research project, we developed the Digital Industrial Symbiosis Ecosystem (DISE) concept as an artifact to guide developing and disseminating industrial symbiosis platforms (ISP). This research is embedded in a design science research approach focusing on design criteria for ISPs. In this paper, we present how we developed and evaluated the DISE concept from the perspective of design science.

Título: A critical review of 3D printing in construction: benefits, challenges, and risks
Resumo: This paper provides a critical review of the related literature on 3D printing in construction. The paper discusses and evaluates the different 3D printing techniques in construction. The paper also discusses and categorizes the benefits, challenges, and risks of 3D printing in construction. The use of 3D printing technology offers several advantages over traditional methods. However, it comes with its own additional challenges and risks. The main benefits of 3D printing in construction include constructability and sustainability benefits. The challenges are categorized into seven groups. The main challenges, found through the literature, are material related. The most cited challenges are material printability, buildability, and open time. Additionally, scalability, structural integrity, and lack of codes and regulations are frequently cited as major challenges. The additional risks are categorized into seven groups: 3D printing material, 3D printing equipment, construction site, and environment, management, stakeholders, regulatory and economic, and cybersecurity risks. The paper fills a gap in the literature as it addresses a new aspect of 3D printing, which is risk. The paper also provides some insights, recommendations, and future research ideas.

Título: A Dynamic Framework to Guide the Implementation and Evaluation of Educational Technologies
Resumo: One vision for Ontario schools is that the use of information and communication technology (ICT) will profoundly change both teaching and learning. Given the diversity of school settings, however, system-wide ICT integration and implementation must necessarily be defined in multiple ways. This paper presents a decision-making framework for guiding the infusion of ICT into different school settings. First, sustainability of the ICT initiative is the identified as the key goal. Next, multiple contextual variables are distilled into five essential qualities. Then, sustainability and the essential elements are combined. The result is a dynamic framework that can be used to identify specific priorities for implementation and strategies for evaluation of ICT initiatives. Finally, it is illustrated how the framework can be used to guide the successful infusion of ICT in any situation, regardless of a school's previous experience with ICT.

Título: A Goal Matching Service for Facilitating Public Collaboration Using Linked Open Data
Resumo: Inter-organizational collaboration in the public sphere is essentially important to address sustainability problems in contemporary regional societies. To facilitate public collaboration, we are developing a Web application for sharing public issues and their solutions as public goals. Since participating in abstract or general goals is more difficult than concrete or specific ones, our system provides a functionality to break down individual public goals into concrete subgoals. Our Web application, GoalShare, is based on a linked open dataset of public goals that are linked with titles, participants, subgoals, related issues, related articles, and related geographic regions. GoalShare recommends public goals and users on the basis of similarity calculations taking into account not only surficial and semantic features but also contextual features extracted from subgoals and supergoals. We conducted experiments to investigate the effects of contextual features in subgoals and supergoals. Moreover, we conducted a trial workshop with GoalShare in Ogaki city to improve system design through actual use.

Título: A Manifesto for Agent Technology: Towards Next Generation Computing
Resumo: The European Commission's eEurope initiative aims to bring every citizen, home, school, business and administration online to create a digitally literate Europe. The value lies not in the objective itself, but in its ability to facilitate the advance of Europe into new ways of living and working. Just as in the first literacy revolution, our lives will change in ways never imagined. The vision of eEurope is underpinned by a technological infrastructure that is now taken for granted. Yet it provides us with the ability to pioneer radical new ways of doing business, of undertaking science, and, of managing our everyday activities. Key to this step change is the development of appropriate mechanisms to automate and improve existing tasks, to anticipate desired actions on our behalf (as human users) and to undertake them, while at the same time enabling us to stay involved and retain as much control as required. For many, these mechanisms are now being realised by agent technologies, which are already providing dramatic and sustained benefits in several business and industry domains, including B2B exchanges, supply chain management, car manufacturing, and so on. While there are many real successes of agent technologies to report, there is still much to be done in research and development for the full benefits to be achieved. This is especially true in the context of environments of pervasive computing devices that are envisaged in coming years. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art of agent technologies and identifies trends and challenges that will need to be addressed over the next 10 years to progress the field and realise the benefits. It offers a roadmap that is the result of discussions among participants from over 150 organisations including universities, research institutions, large multinational corporations and smaller IT start-up companies. The roadmap identifies successes and challenges, and points to future possibilities and demands; agent technologies are fundamental to the realisation of next generation computing.

Título: A Multi-criteria Decision-Making Approach to Analyze Python Code Smells
Resumo: Frequent modifications in the software leads to the issues in the code which deteriorates software quality. The suitable approach to rectify it is to refactor it. Consequently, this research devises a ranking using the MCDM approach for prioritizing Python-based code smells. This order ranking has been studied over 10,552 classes for five generic code smells diffused in 20 Python software. The software metrics extracted over these python classes have been considered as multiple criteria which are processed using rule-based machine learning approach. In this study, an approach providing compromised solution—VIKOR have been practiced along with TOPSIS and WASPAS methods. Additionally, the MCDM approaches have utilized Shannon’s Entropy and CRITIC method as weight estimation techniques. The extracted vital software metrics achieved over 90% accuracy. The prominent outcome portrays that the most dominant smell is Collapsible “IF” which needs to be refactored at the early stage. This should be accompanied by Cognitive Complexity smell so as to attain sustainable development environment.

Título: A Neural Blockchain for Requirements Traceability: BC4RT Prototype
Resumo: The ever-increasing globalization of the software industry presents challenges related to requirements engineering activities. Managing requirements’ changes and tracing software artifacts is not trivial in a multi-site environment composed of a variety of stakeholders that do not trust each other. In this study, we propose a neural blockchain prototype for the traceability of requirements (BC4RT) throughout the software development lifecycle in interorganizational software projects. The prototype is implemented using a neural blockchain platform, namely NDL ArcaNet, due to its inherent properties: performance efficiency, sustainability, and scalability. Besides these features, the proposed prototype provides a holistic and reliable view of software artifacts, requirements’ changes, and trace links. The increased visibility enhances collaboration, communication, and trust among stakeholders, and can potentially improve software development efficiency and quality.

Título: A new approach in designing low vision aids (LVA)
Resumo: In reading text, two processes can be discriminated: 1) the search for desired information on the page, and 2) the process of processing information once the desired spot on the page has been found. A global overview is given about the research on the structure of the visual system and how this system is used in normal reading and reading by people with low vision (LVP). It is concluded that research has been concentrated at the second process of the reading process and that no knowledge is available on how LVP can use their residual visual function to enable search. It is argued that visual search is of increasing importance in our modern society and that low vision aids (LVA) should support visual search. It is assumed that betters LVA can be developed on the basis of an ‘Ecological approach to visual perception’ (Gibson (1979).

Título: A novel hybrid requirement’s prioritization approach based on critical software project factors
Resumo: Requirements prioritization is essential for development of quality software products. Requirements prioritization helps focus on the most important requirements between the available software requirements. This process is also called preserving core vision according to customer viewpoint or managing the quality requirements. Many requirements prioritization techniques have been proposed in the Software Engineering field. However, one requirement prioritization technique can only be generalized for some software projects. This research effort aims to develop a sustainable hybrid model for requirements prioritization, utilizing critical software project factors. The prioritization technique is shortlisted from a pool of software prioritization techniques, based on these project factors and their quantized scores. The proposed model is equipped with state-of-the-art literature to provide a customized prioritization technique improving the requirements prioritization process for a specific software project. The paper also presents popular software prioritization techniques used in the software industry and an extensive comparison using a thorough empirical analysis. Finally, the quantization of the software project factors for each technique has been assessed for better understanding, and a sustainable hybrid model has been constructed. With the proposed hybrid model, requirements prioritization in software development has been controlled effectively, reducing the failure risks and increasing the overall benefit and success rate. The success of the proposed hybrid approach is verified with two software case studies attaining satisfactory results and improving the organization's productivity by incorporating pivotal software requirements on which all the stakeholders agree. Furthermore, an automated approach will be developed by implementing the proposed approach to benefit from human–machine collaboration, improving user satisfaction by incorporating end-user opinions effectively and timely.

Título: A Novel Technique to Assess Agile Systems for Stability
Resumo: Agile systems, like the Kanban and Scrum frameworks, are built on assumptions of sustainability and stability, however, there is little empirical evidence on whether such systems are stable in practice or not. Therefore, in this study we aim to inspect the stability of Agile systems by leveraging the concept of stability described in Queueing Theory. We define a novel metric, the Stability Metric, as a way of assessing queueing systems, especially Agile systems. We inspect 926 Jira projects in 14 organizations with over 1.6 million product backlog items using this metric. The analysis showed that 72.89% of these Jira projects were not stable and stable systems, on average, had product backlog sizes 10 times shorter than unstable ones. These results suggest that while the goal of Agile is to create a sustainable, stable way of working, this is not guaranteed, and a better understanding of systems and queues may be required to help design, create, coach, and maintain optimal Agile systems.

Título: A Problem-Based Learning Approach for Green Control and IT in a Master Program
Resumo: Students’ interest for science and technology studies has been decreasing during the last decade, to the profit of careers with more social impact or economic benefit. While the economic aspect is related to industrial policies and out of reach for university curriculum designers, problem-based learning (PBL) can be a solution to renew the students’ interest for science. This work presents an example of curriculum design at the master level where the theoretical classes of systems, control and information technologies (SCIT) are illustrated with PBL-oriented labs and projects related to a topic with high social impact: environmental sustainability. The focus of the paper is on practice and experience sharing; the general approach to motivate the need for SCIT in sustainable and green development is presented, along with some specific projects carried in the master program. The perspective of relying on Web 2.0 tools to improve communication and collaboration in the PBL framework is also discussed.

Título: A Reference Process to Design Information Systems for Sustainable Design Based on LCA, PSS, Social and Economic Aspects
Resumo: The purpose of Sustainable Design, SD, is to satisfy customer needs while reducing environmental impacts. The main challenge is to integrate Life Cycle Assessment, Product Service Systems, social and economic aspects while considering the tensions and trade-offs of each activity in depth. SD requires data from many sources in addition to many software tools to perform each analysis. In order to provide information systems for SD, the adoption of a Service-Oriented Architecture, SOA, is appropriate because of its integration requirements. SOA best practices recommend the design of a reference process prior to architectural definitions, so as to identify the complexities and provide a comprehensive solution to the problem. A reference process is presented here as the first step for building information systems for SD. In addition, the reference process presents a list of activities to be performed during the design stage and is very helpful as a guide for SD beginners.

Título: A social VR-based collaborative exergame for rehabilitation: codesign, development and user study
Resumo: Immersive virtual reality (VR)-based exercise video games (exergames) are increasingly being employed as a supportive intervention in rehabilitation programs to promote engagement in physical activity, especially for elderly users. A multifaceted and iterative codesign process is essential to develop sustainable exergaming solutions. The social aspect is considered one of the key motivating factors in exergames; however, research on the social aspect of VR exergames has been limited. Previous studies have relied on competitiveness in exergames, but research has shown that competition can lead to adverse effects on users. With the aim of motivating elderly individuals to participate in physical exercise and improving social connectedness during rehabilitation, this work presents a social VR-based collaborative exergame codesigned with elderly participants and therapists. This exergame stimulates full-body exercise and supports social collaboration among users through a collaborative game task. Furthermore, this article presents a user study based on a mixed-methods approach to gather user feedback on exergame design and the effect of social collaboration versus playing alone in a VR exergame in terms of physical exertion and motivation. This study spanned five weeks (99 exergaming sessions) with 14 elderly participants divided into two groups, one playing collaboratively and the other playing individually. Between-group comparisons were performed at baseline (first week) and in the fourth week, and within-group comparisons were performed in the fifth week, when the participants played the exergame in counterbalanced order. In contrast to the first week, the participants exergaming collaboratively in the fourth week reported significantly higher intrinsic motivation on all subscales (enjoyment: p < 0.02, effort: p < 0.002, usefulness: p < 0.01) and physical exertion (p < 0.001) than those playing alone. Thereafter, exergaming in counterbalanced order during the fifth week resulted in significant differences (medium to large effect size) within groups. The participants found the social VR gameplay enjoyable and agreed that collaboration played a vital role in their motivation. They reported various health benefits, a minimal increase in symptoms of simulator sickness, and excellent usability scores (83.75±13.3). In this work, we also identify various key design principles to support healthcare professionals, researchers and industrial experts in developing ergonomic and sustainable VR-based exergames for senior citizens.

Título: A SPICE-Based Maturity Model for the Governance and Management of Green IT
Resumo: Organizations around the world are increasingly concerned about the environment, adopting sustainable practices in their business processes. In the field of Information Technologies (IT) several Green IT practices have been proposed, but in isolation, so a framework is needed if the Green IT is to be implemented and improved in an efficient and integrated way. In this paper, we propose a maturity model (based on SPICE) to help organizations to implement the governance and management of Green IT gradually, as well as to improve their maturity level in this area. The validation of this proposal by experts and a case study seems to indicate that the proposal can be useful for implementing and improving the Green IT processes in organizations.

Título: A survey of model-driven techniques and tools for cyber-physical systems
Resumo: Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) have emerged as a potential enabling technology to handle the challenges in social and economic sustainable development. Since it was proposed in 2006, intensive research has been conducted, showing that the construction of a CPS is a hard and complex engineering process due to the nature of integrating a large number of heterogeneous subsystems. Among other approaches to dealing with the complex design issues, model-driven design of CPSs has shown its advantages. In this review paper, we present a survey of research on model-driven development of CPSs. We are concerned mainly with the widely used methods, techniques, and tools, and discuss how these are applied to CPSs. We also present comparative analyses on the surveyed techniques and tools from various perspectives, including their modeling languages, functionalities, and the challenges which they address in CPS design. With our understanding of the surveyed methods, we believe that model-driven approaches are an inevitable choice in building CPSs and further research effort is needed in the development of model-driven theories, techniques, and tools. We also argue that a unified modeling platform is needed. Such a platform would benefit research in the academic community and practical development in industry, and improve the collaboration between these two communities.

Título: A Sustainability Requirements Catalog for the Social and Technical Dimensions
Resumo: Sustainability poses key challenges in software development for its complexity. Our goal is to contribute with a reusable sustainability software requirements catalog. We started by performing a systematic mapping to elicit and extract sustainability-related properties, and synthesized the results in feature models. Next we used iStar to model a more expressive configurable catalog with the collected data, and implemented a tool with several operations on the sustainability catalog. The sustainability catalog was qualitatively evaluated regarding its readability, interest, utility, and usefulness by 50 participants from the domain. The results were encouraging, showing that, on average, 79% of the respondents found the catalog “Good” or “Very Good” in endorsing the quality criteria evaluated. This paper discusses the social and technical dimensions of the sustainability catalog.

Título: A systematic literature review about integrating dependability attributes, performability and sustainability in the implantation of cooling subsystems in data center
Resumo: In recent years, data centers (DCs) have evolved a lot, and this change is related to the advent of cloud computing, e-commerce, services aimed at social networks, and big data. Such architectures demand high availability, reliability, and performance at satisfactory service levels; requirements are often neglected at the expense of high costs. In addition, the use of techniques capable of promoting greater environmental sustainability is most often forgotten in the design phase of such architectures. Approaches to perform an integrated assessment of dependability attributes for DCs, in general, are not trivial. Thus, this work presents the dependability attributes (availability and reliability), performability, and sustainability parameters that need special attention in implementing a cooling subsystem in DCs. That is one of the most cost generators for these infrastructures. In this study, we use the hypothetical-deductive method through a quantitative and qualitative approach; as for the procedure, it is bibliographical research through the review of scientific studies, and the research objectives are exploratory in nature. The results show that among all the papers selected and analyzed in this systematic literature review (SLR), none have jointly addressed performability, dependability, and sustainability in cooling systems for DCs. The main results of this work are presented through research questions, as they bring evidence of gaps to be addressed in the area. The four research questions point out challenges in implementing cooling systems in DCs and present the techniques and/or methods most used to propose or analyze data center cooling infrastructures; addressing the essential sustainability requirements for cooling subsystems, and finally, presenting open questions that can be investigated in the area of sustainable cooling in DCs regarding the data center’s cooling and the difficulty of incorporating dependability attributes in the environmental context. In addition to these results, the present study actively contributes to the concept of a “green data center” for the companies, which ranges from the choice of renewable energy sources to more efficient information technology equipment. Hence, we show the relevance and originality of this SLR and its results.

Título: A systematic literature review of modular product design (MPD) from the perspective of sustainability
Resumo: Modular product design (MPD), as its name implies, subdivides complicated products and systems into components and considers them individually instead of as an amalgamated whole. Because of its merit in reducing complexity, MPD is widely used in engineering fields, especially in design engineering. Over the last decade, increasing concerns about environmental impact have driven manufacturers to reconsider their product design processes from the view of sustainability. The blending of these concepts—modularity and sustainability—has attracted significant attention from both academia and industry. The ways in which sustainability influences MPD are not fully understood, evidencing a gap that needs to be further researched. This review examines more than 100 studies addressing ways MPD is associated with sustainability factors and classifies these studies based on major sustainability themes. The initial review and analysis were conducted using literature summarization tables and a maturity index. Our search emphasized not only the performance of MPD methodologies with respect to sustainability factors but also the relationship between MPD and sustainability categories. Our review results indicate that from an academic perspective, research over the last 15 years has seen a significant increase in studies involving MPD and product life cycles, MPD and product innovation, and MPD and environmental management. Secondarily, our findings reveal that from an industry perspective, the literature shows that modularity has a positive impact on sustainability and identifies several social sustainability-related areas in MPD that could benefit from further investigation.

Título: A Systematic Literature Review of Social Network Systems for Older Adults
Resumo: Background. The proportion of older adults (OAs) is increasing throughout the developed world. Social isolation is a recognised problem for this sector. Technology is regarded as a possible way to create a more inclusive society, where for example social network systems (SNSs) can keep OAs in contact with local communities, create new communities, reduce adverse impact of geographic separation, reduced mobility and lifestyle changes. Objective. As end-users of SNSs, this paper looks at the current state of practice of SNSs for OAs. We explore what OAs think about SNSs, what they want from SNSs and whether these needs are met. Method. Taking a snowballing approach, we examined 51 primary studies on SNSs for OAs. Results. There is a discernible increase in SNSs designed for OAs since 2005, which claim to meet needs such as simplicity, ease of use, privacy and access to useful information. Yet, sustained use over time is unknown. Conclusion. SNSs remain a potential way to reduce the social isolation of OAs, however the extent to which SNSs can replace real human contact is largely unexplored, as is whether SNSs can trigger the creation of new supportive communities.

Título: A Systematic Literature Review on Agile Coaching and the Role of the Agile Coach
Resumo: There has been a recent increase in the use of agile coaches in organizations. Although the use of the job title is popular, empirical knowledge about the tasks, responsibilities and skills of an agile coach is lacking. In this paper, we present a systematic literature review on agile coaching and the role of the agile coach. The initial search resulted in a total of 209 studies identified on the topic. Based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 67 studies were selected as primary studies. Our findings suggest that agile coaching facilitates the adoption and sustainability of agile methods and deals with agile adoption challenges. Agile coaches help in training and developing software development teams and all the stakeholders involved in the agile adoption process. The primary skills of an agile coach identified herein are leadership qualities, project management skills, technical skills, and expertise in agile methods. Based on the findings, it can be argued that agile coaches play a significant role in addressing challenges in an agile transformation such as resistance to change. Coaches focus on removing barriers to team autonomy in agile teams and making agile meetings more valuable. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Título: A Systematic Review of Sustainable Supply Chain Management Practices in Food Industry
Resumo: The food industry is central to human beings and heavily impacts the lives of the entire society. Nowadays, the sustainable development goal and the introduction of new information and communication technologies has led food companies to deal with this new paradigm. They require sustainable practices that have the dual objective of improving the overall performance of the company itself and fulfilling the sustainability requirement. Research works on sustainable supply chain management practices in the food industry is quite fragmented, as it often considers just a part of the chain. Therefore, through a systematic literature review, this paper aims to provide an up-to-date analysis of supply chain management practices within the scope of sustainability, studying the findings of 224 reviewed papers. The implications of this work are relevant for academic research as they enlarge the body of knowledge and highlight key points where there is the need to investigate further. From a practical point of view this study proposes an overview of the most common and adopted practices that can be implemented in order to achieve sustainable development in the food industry.

Título: A Systematic Review on the Use of Ontologies in the Internet of Things
Resumo: The Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm that has gained significant importance within the scientific community and industry. This paradigm introduces a favorable impact on people's life quality and the sustainable development of society. However, IoT systems operate in very complex and uncertain scenarios. An approach to simplify the development and maintenance of these systems is the use of ontological models due to their expressive, semantic and extensible capacity. Therefore, this study presents a systematic review to know the state of the art on the use of ontologies in the IoT domain, following Kitchenham's methodological guide. This review aims to answer the following questions: i) What are the purposes of using ontological models in IoT? ii) How are ontological models implemented in IoT? and iii) How is addressed the research in studies related to the construction of ontological models in the IoT? First, 453 primary studies were retrieved. Then, 23 relevant studies on ontological model approaches were selected due to applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, a quality checklist was applied to the selected studies, and qualitative and quantitative methods were used to focus the presentation and discussion of the review results correctly. The results include the strengths and limitations of the approaches and research gaps, challenges, and opportunities.

Título: A Systematic-Oriented Process for Tool Selection: The Case of Green and Technical Debt Tools in Architecture Reconstruction
Resumo: Well-established methods in software engineering research, such as Systematic Literature Reviews, Systematic Mappings and Case Studies are effective research methods to explore emerging areas, since they are systematic and replicable, and produce reusable result avoiding bias. Frequently, software engineers have to evaluate and select CASE (Computer Aided Software Engineering) tools that address trending issues with a non-systematic and replicable processes. This work addresses this problem by tailoring the ISO/IEC 14102:2008 to a systematic-oriented process for the evaluation of software engineering CASE tools in order to embrace the advantages of software engineering systematic methods in the exploration of new areas or emerging issues. This tailored ISO/IEC 14102:2008 standard prescribes a process for the preparation, design and conduction of the software engineering CASE tools evaluation and selection. This process is founded in the application of systematic methods and the generation of a pre-established assets to ensure the reusability of knowledge. In this paper, this tailored process has been applied to address two great emerging concerns in architectural reconstruction: technical debt and energy consumption. As result of this adoption, this paper details the reporting analysis and the set of reusable assets that have been generated during the evaluation process. Specifically, this contribution presents a set of tables, statistics and a decision-making tree of the selected tools for technical debt and energy consumption analysis in architecture reconstruction. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Título: ‘Acted Reality’ in Electronic Patient Record Research: A Bridge between Laboratory and Ethnographic Studies
Resumo: This paper describes and reflects on the development and use of ‘acted reality’ scenarios to study variability in General Practitioners’ (GPs’) record keeping practices, particularly their use of free text and coded entries. With actors playing the part of patients and in control of certain elements of the interaction, the acted reality approach creates a bridge between the controlled but often unrealistic laboratory setting and the arguably more ‘realistic’ but often messy world observed in traditional ethnographic studies. The skills and techniques of actors were compelling, helping to develop and sustain interaction, whilst keeping the process on track and providing rich data. This paper discusses the benefits and challenges of working with actors in this specific context and argues that the acted reality approach might be applied elsewhere in HCI research, especially in contexts where there are multiple individuals involved, but where the behaviour of one user is of special interest.

Systematic literature research has been carried out (from 2006 to 2023) to highlight research gaps and challenges associated with lattice structures, simulation modelling, 3D prints, and structural tests. The study portrays insufficient investigations on fused deposition modelling and stereolithography-based lattice structures with polymers, composites, and metals, limited lattice structures comparative output data, design not withstanding specific energy absorption, low mechanical properties of materials and lattice, lag on the ceramic resins study. The authors report that by applying topology optimisation, comparison, and combination of lattice structures, the use of functionally graded materials, multi-material structures, controlled porosity and flexibility, they can resolve these challenges. The authors are hopeful that this research will be useful for next generation researchers and practitioners in miniaturisation and green product development.

Título: Adoption and sustainability of bitcoin and the blockchain technology in Nigeria
Resumo: The rise of cryptocurrency, especially bitcoin, has opened up a lot of doors in the world of Financial Technology (FinTech) by attracting investors, media, and financial industry regulators. Bitcoin operates on blockchain technology, and its value is not a determinant of the value of a tangible asset, an organisation, or a country’s economy. Instead, it relies on an encryption technique that allows tracking of all transactions. Globally, over $2 trillion has been generated through cryptocurrency trading. Due to these financial prospects, the youths in Nigeria have cashed in on this virtual currency to create employment and wealth. This research investigates the adoption and sustainability of bitcoin and blockchain in Nigeria. A survey method with a non-probability purposive sampling technique and a homogeneous approach was employed to collect 320 responses via an online survey. Descriptive and correlational analysis in IBM SPSS version 25 was used to analyse the collected data. According to the findings, bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, with 97.5% acceptance, and is expected to be the leading virtual currency in the next five years. The research findings will help researchers and authorities comprehend the need for cryptocurrency adoption, leading to its sustainability.

Título: Agile challenges in practice: A thematic analysis
Resumo: As agile is maturing and becoming more widely adopted, it is important that researchers are aware of the challenges faced by practitioners and organisations. We undertook a thematic analysis of 193 agile challenges collected at a series of agile conferences and events during 2013 and 2014. Participants were mainly practitioners and business representatives along with some academics. The challenges were thematically analysed by separate authors, synthesised, and a list of seven themes and 27 sub-themes was agreed. Themes were Organisation, Sustainability, Culture, Teams, Scale, Value and Claims and Limitations. We compare our findings against previous attempts to identify and categorise agile challenges. While most themes have persisted we found a shift of focus towards sustainability, business engagement and transformation, as well as claims and limitations. We identify areas for further research and a need for innovative methods of conveying academic research to industry and industrial problems to academia. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

Título: Aligning Higher Education in Ukraine with the Demands for Data Science Workforce
Resumo: Accelerated technological development in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution changed the nature of competition in world markets, increasing the importance of technological opportunities as a source of competitive advantage and identifying technology as a key factor in production. Every year, digital technologies change everyday life, creating the foundations for sustainable socio-economic development. Changes resulting from the revolution in information technology signal the need for new approaches to training, particularly in Ukraine. Technologies are improving at a fairly rapid pace, but the methodological base at the level of Ukrainian high education institutions (HEIs) is adapting to such changes rather slowly, which, accordingly, slows down the process of “smarting” of education. In turn, graduates are not the most attractive for the modern labour market. This article highlights the urgent need for extensive training in this area. In turn, the paper aims to offer a case of the study programme for graduating data science analysts (DSAs). The original approach is the master degree programme case for the social science faculty but not for engineering faculty as it is traditionally. The necessity of DSAs is extremely high in the economic field/business however mostly graduates of the engineering faculties having strong programming skills lack the economic knowledge and understanding of business laws. The contribution of the paper is that the proposed program differs from existing ones on the market, but is not implemented in HEIs, with its systematical adaptability to the requirements of the state standard; as well it meets all the requirements of employers in the field of Data Science. The paper is mostly in the practical and descriptive area thus the methodological base of the research are general scientific research methods like historical method, comparative analysis, methods of analyses & synthesis, system approach and logical generalization.

Título: An Agent-Based Extensible Climate Control System for Sustainable Greenhouse Production
Resumo: The slow adoption pace of new control strategies for sustainable greenhouse climate control by industrial growers, is mainly due to the complexity of identifying and resolving potentially conflicting climate control requirements. In this paper, we present a multi-agent-based climate control system that allows new control strategies to be adopted without any need to identify or resolve conflicts beforehand. This is achieved by representing the climate control requirements as separate agents. Identifying and solving conflicts then becomes a negotiation problem among agents sharing the same controlled environment. Negotiation is done using a novel multi-objective negotiation protocol that uses a generic algorithm to find an optimized solution within the search space. The multi-agent-based control system has been empirically evaluated in an ornamental floriculture research facility in Denmark. The evaluation showed that it is realistic to implement the climate control requirements as individual agents, thereby opening greenhouse climate control systems for integration of independently produced control strategies.

Título: An Artifact Ecology in a Nutshell: A Distributed Cognition Perspective for Collaboration and Coordination
Resumo: An artifact ecology is an environment where multiple heterogeneous technologies co-exist and are interlinked as a unified system. To construct effective ecologies of artifacts for collaborative activities we need to acquire deep understanding of the complex interactions and interdependencies between users and tools. Researchers have identified Distributed Cognition (DC) as a powerful tool for understanding these interdependencies. In this study, DC, and particularly the DiCoT framework, were considered ideal for constructing this understanding for four student-groups during collaborative activities in an artifact ecology. Using DiCoT we analysed learners’ behaviour and how the artifact ecology supported collaboration and cooperation. The cognitive system was described from three different perspectives - physical layout, information flow and artifacts - which (i) allowed an in-depth understanding of the interactions among learners and tools during collaborative activities and (ii) provided insights on how the affordances of the artifact ecology supported collaboration and coordination.

Título: An empirical comparison of developer retention in the RubyGems and npm software ecosystems
Resumo: Software ecosystems can be viewed as socio-technical networks consisting of technical components (software packages) and social components (communities of developers) that maintain the technical components. Ecosystems evolve over time through socio-technical changes that may greatly impact the ecosystem’s sustainability. Social changes like developer turnover may lead to technical degradation. This motivates the need to identify those factors leading to developer abandonment, in order to automate the process of identifying developers with high abandonment risk. This paper compares such factors for two software package ecosystems, RubyGems and npm. We analyse the evolution of their packages hosted on GitHub, considering development activity in terms of commits, and social interaction with other developers in terms of comments associated to commits, issues or pull requests. We analyse this socio-technical activity for more than 30 and 60k developers for RubyGems and npm, respectively. We use survival analysis to identify which factors coincide with a lower survival probability. Our results reveal that developers with a higher probability to abandon an ecosystem: do not engage in discussions with other developers; do not have strong social and technical activity intensity; communicate or commit less frequently; and do not participate to both technical and social activities for long periods of time. Such observations could be used to automate the identification of developers with a high probability of abandoning the ecosystem and, as such, reduce the risks associated to knowledge loss.

Título: An Energy Consumption Perspective on Software Architecture
Resumo: The rising energy consumption of the ICT industry has triggered a quest for more sustainable, i.e. energy efficient, ICT solutions. Software plays an essential role in finding these solutions, as software is identified as the true consumer of power. However, in this context, software is often treated as a single, complex entity which fails to provide detailed insight in the elements that invoke specific energy consumption behavior.

Título: An Exploration Towards Sustainable Metaverse Systems for e-Learning by Student Designers: A Meta-analysis
Resumo: The metaverse has caught the imagination and investments of many. However, in developing countries, the metaverse may raise more questions, than answers. As such, this study aims to investigate first, student-designers’ perceptions towards what and how they want the metaverse to be like, and whether students would prioritize information flow; second, the efficacy of triangulating 3 usability-HCI questionnaires; third, whether student-designers would be more interested, creative, and be more confident in designing and developing for interconnecting (non) metaverse (eco)systems. Findings from alpha-beta user testings of Figma prototypes indicate preference for balance between structure and freedom/creativity, enhanced by user feedback and open ecosystems. Mind maps, sequencing of chain of effects in descending order, and the derived hierarchical relationship reflect centralities in design, and continuums in notions of what sustainable interconnected systems in the metaverse may be like. They are influenced by how perspectives, objectives, utility functions, and evaluation criteria, dynamically affect shifts in these centrality of design (dy/dx) over time (dy/dt), based on demographics. Loosely coupled pointer-based systems, are thus viable complements to integration.

Título: An Exploratory Study on Managing Agile Transition and Adoption
Resumo: Software companies are replacing traditional software development methods with Agile methods due to coping with inherent problems of traditional methods. Due to the different nature of traditional and Agile methods, adaptation to Agile methods is not a simple process and needs to be managed in a sustainable way. In recent years, several studies have conducted on investigation of Agile migration journey, but less effort on identifying the serious managerial attentions in Agile transition process. Conducting a Grounded Theory in context of Agile software development, showed various aspects of the transition to be considered in order to having a successful change management process. This paper shows the important role of the emergent managerial attentions on success of Agile transition and adoption process.

Título: An Exploratory Study on Websites Quality Assessment
Resumo: The website of a company may be a real and sustainable competitive advantage. However, the quality of web applications does not increase as well as their rapid development. In software engineering many quality models were proposed. Research on website quality is prolific. State-of-the-arts on website quality have already been published. However, due to the productivity of this research field, this paper proposes an update of this literature in order to be able to sketch future research avenues on website quality. We analyze how the current approaches cover the large spectrum of web application quality factors. This paper aims at checking whether the main metrics proposed by researchers can be mapped towards ISO 9126 quality sub-characteristics and how this mapping covers the six main characteristics.

Título: An Extension of the Babel Protocol to Include Operating Cost: Providing Sustainability in Community Networks
Resumo: The expansion of networks worldwide and its benefits allowed the emergence and application of several technologies aimed at exchanging information in a decentralized manner, such as Blockchain, where there is no need for a reliable agent or third party for management. In this context, the emergence of various distributed wireless networks was possible, such as community networks, where large mesh networks composed of hundreds of nodes built by communities seek to solve digital inclusion problems. Wireless mesh networks still present some challenges in their growth. Even with specific protocols like Babel, which optimize its operation, there are problems such as reliability among network members and the correct distribution of resources to encourage its growth. These characteristics prevent wireless mesh networks from developing to reach areas of technology scarcity called the last mile. Thus, this work uses the optimization techniques for WMNs achieved by the Babel protocol and proposes the modification of the original Babel protocol to insert financial incentive mechanisms into the protocol. The article presents the proposed modifications and demonstrates, through simulation tests, the functioning and efficiency of the protocol extensions through the OMNeT++ platform combined with the INET Framework tool.

Título: An Indoor Farming Framework for Decision Support Towards Food Security in Society 5.0
Resumo: One of the key aspects outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), is food security. The discourse around food security recognizes that resources such as water and land are finite, and the agenda to end hunger remains a major challenge. Furthermore, the objective of Society 5.0, to integrate digital technologies and a human-centered society to foster economic advancement and the resolution of social problems, augmented the reasons to address food security. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to consider indoor farming as an agricultural technology capable of producing more food using fewer resources, as opposed to traditional farming, that is enabled through targeted capital investments. We developed an Integrated Farming Framework (IFF) with the aim to provide decision support to guide potential investors in indoor farming. Ten key aspects were identified and mapped to the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, identifying a fourth construct, societal context. These constructs include the basic elements required for investors to consider financing in indoor farming projects. By applying the IFF, investors will be able to consider their investment options holistically.

Título: An Integrated Approach for Exploring Opportunities and Vulnerabilities of Complex Territorial Systems
Resumo: Dealing with territorial transformations assessment means addressing the challenge represented by the inherent complexity and multidimensionality of these systems. This requires an integrated approach for the evaluation in order to obtain concise final judgments. Moreover, when dealing with territorial systems, the analysis of the geographical patterns of the elements under investigation plays a fundamental role. The paper thus proposes an innovative approach for the analysis of a complex territorial system based on the integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and a specific Multicriteria Analysis technique, named Analytic Network Process (ANP). In particular, starting from a real case related to a mountain area in Northern Italy, the present paper explores the potentialities of spatial Multicriteria analysis for supporting strategic planning and sustainability assessment procedures.

Título: An Overview of Challenges and Research Avenues for Green Business Process Management
Resumo: Business organizations acknowledge the importance of Information Systems (IS) to cope with their responsibility in environmental degradation. The problem with current IS contributions is that the crucial role of process-centered techniques is often ignored. Moreover, a common understanding of environmental sustainability is missing. In response, this paper introduces Green Business Process Management (BPM) which focuses on the ecological impact of business processes. The concept of a circular economy is introduced to concretize environmental sustainability at the organizational level. Following the design-science paradigm, this paper provides a work plan to examine the theoretical and practical evidence on Green BPM instruments. The research methods we propose are a systematic literature review (SLR), expert panels, case studies and field-testing.

This paper will discuss the use cases of elderly products, taking lifting bath accessories as an example. Find out the weight factors and influence of design and implementation in the whole life cycle of the product, and play a positive role in product design optimization, especially in application and experience [2]. Based on the background of limited application of this method in non-material design of service types such as welfare design, driven by the concept of sustainable design, the whole life cycle of development, operation, production, use and product is developed through the concept of sustainable ecological design. Prove the case study and application value in the development of such products.

Título: Are Teammate Trust and Confidence Dissociable in Risk Intensive Human Machine Teaming?
Resumo: Although automation has become the focus of an increasingly expansive body of research literature in human machine team development, few studies have examined the distinction between confidence in a teammate’s capabilities and trust in their intentions. Fewer still have examined the relationship between these two important components of reliance under naturalistic conditions of high risk. We launch into this void with an initial examination of historical case studies which suggest that risk can act as a catalyst that surprisingly and profoundly transforms the relationship between confidence and trust from a typically convergent and positive influence on teammate reliance to a divergent one that can substantially diminish it. We further examine these historical events as rare yet profound occurrences which take place outside the university/hospital laboratory environment in which the vast majority of scientific conclusions are drawn from the behavior of young college students with immature frontal lobes performing artificial tasks under emotionally sterile, risk-averse conditions. We close with the ambitious goal of inspiring a shift within the Human Machine Interaction and Cognitive Engineering fields toward naturalistic, risk intensive research with increased ecological validity for the military and first responder communities.

Título: Assessing Sustainability Impacts of Systems: SuSAF and the SDGs
Resumo: The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) identify key topics where action is required to transform our world towards sustainability. We call for the extensive integration of the SDGs into Software Engineering to support this transformation. This will require the creation of methods and tools for the analysis of software system impacts on the SDGs. To show how this integration might be achieved, we report on a mapping to the SDGs from an existing software sustainability assessment tool, the Sustainability Assessment Framework (SusAF). We find that there is a good mapping between SusAF and the SDGs but that mapping to some specific SDG targets may be dependant on the expertise of the analysts. Mapping of case study systems will be needed for empirical validation.

Título: Assessing the Reusability of Design Principles in the Realm of Conversational Agents
Resumo: Conversational Agents (CAs) provide the means to foster user experience design through seizing their interaction capability, knowledgeability, and human-like behavior. To support practice and academia in designing CAs, IS researchers have been creating design knowledge in the form of design principles (DPs) guided by the Design Science paradigm. However, scientific literature in this vein is dispersed and lacks an axis of cohesion and transferability to sustained practice usage. This raises the question of reusability of design principles in the realm of CAs. Therefore, in this study, we conduct a Systematic Literature Review to retrieve and assess design principles of existing design science papers dealing with CAs with regard to their reusability. Our findings indicate that the Design Science community, in our case in the domain of CAs, seems to face challenges in creating reusable design principles. We discuss this observation and provide avenues on how to move forward.

Título: Assisted Facility Layout Planning for Sustainable Automotive Assembly
Resumo: Decisions in factory layout planning can be considered multi-dimensional and complex since they need to cope with numerous partially conflicting boundary conditions and objectives. However, they do have a significant impact on long-term efficiency and flexibility. Due to rising needs in this area, an assisted solution for optimizing factory layout planning is required. Generative Design (GD) is a summarizing term for iterative, mostly nature-analogue approaches that support an efficient analysis of large design spaces, allowing to effortlessly achieve mathematically optimized solutions not usually achievable by traditional methods. Although there have been decades of research on the underlying principles, generative planning of spatial arrangements for manufacturing facilities still lacks behind its potential. Therefore, the proposed paper will begin with a structured overview of terminology and different factory planning requirements, followed by possible mathematical approaches for facility layout planning problems (FLP) in manufacturing. Special attention is drawn to sustainability aspects, defining the requirements to be considered in an automated design and including empirical knowledge in complex scenarios. The paper finishes with the derivation of identified future research areas.

Título: Barriers Faced by Newcomers to Open Source Projects: A Systematic Review
Resumo: To remain sustainable, some open source projects need a constant influx of new volunteers, or newcomers. However, the newcomers face different kinds of problems when onboarding to a project. In this paper we present the results of a systematic literature review aiming at identifying the barriers that a newcomer can face when contributing to an Open Source Software project. We identified and analyzed 21 studies that evidence this kind of problem. As a result we provide a hierarchical model that relies on five categories of barriers: finding a way to start, social interactions, code issues, documentation problems and newcomers’ knowledge. The most evidenced barriers are newcomers’ previous technical skills, receiving response from community, centrality of social contacts, and finding the appropriate way to start contributing. This classification provides a baseline for further researches related to newcomers onboarding.

Título: Brief Overview of Collaborative Approaches in Sustainable Manufacturing
Resumo: The manufacturing sector is experiencing a profound transformation as reflected in the Industry 4.0 movement, combined with the growing societal concerns for sustainability. This trend has led to the notion of sustainable manufacturing. On the other hand, the increasing interconnectivity among organisations, people, and physical systems, supported by recent developments in communication technologies, points to the important role that collaborative networks have in the ongoing digital transformation processes. As such, this paper analyses the synergies between sustainable manufacturing and collaborative networks. More specifically, the goal is to analyse how the responsibility for the various facets of sustainability can be distributed among the multiple entities involved in manufacturing. This study is based on both literature survey and our experience in various research projects in the area and is organised according to the typical six dimensions of Industry 4.0. The work is complemented with a brief summary of proposed indicators to measure sustainability under this networked manufacturing perspective.

Título: Business Model for Indie Studios in Game Software Ecosystems
Resumo: The games industry is constantly growing. The emerging players are mostly software developers who join together with professionals from different fields to form independent (or indie) studios. This movement has resulted in an exponential amount of new products, and some big game companies have adopted a differentiated strategy to capture value in this scenario. This innovative strategy, explored with the concept of Software Ecosystems (SECO), led to the development of common technological platforms where players integrate their products. The competition between the players, the constant technological changes and evolution, and the need for agile and high-quality production due to the demands of the consumer market and the long-term financial sustainability bring challenges to the independent studios regarding their business planning. This chapter aims to present one of the grand research challenges on games and digital entertainment, more specifically related to business modeling for independent studios that work in Game SECO (GSECO). By presenting a unified agenda, we expect that the digital games industry and academia actors could join efforts to propose and validate solutions, leveraging the growth of the digital games’ scenario.

Título: Carving Sustainability into Architecture Knowledge Practice
Resumo: In the daily work of a software architect, knowledge is ubiquitous. In addition to technical expertise, architecture knowledge (AK) also requires practical experience in the representation, communication, and management of architectural decisions. However, there is a pressing need to also incorporate sustainability aspects, i.e., capturing decisions towards software systems that are environmentally, economically, and socially balanced in the long term. With this study, we aim to provide a review of AK concepts and their representation and communication from a practical point of view. Having this understanding, we explore where sustainability can be applied in daily practice and how we can address sustainability in architecture processes in the future. The paper presents an empirical study conducted in an industrial context encompassing a questionnaire survey with 32 participants and semi-structured interviews with 15 practitioners; both groups are from a major bank in the Netherlands. Based on the insights gained from combining our findings, we (i) provide a map of applied concepts for communicating and representing AK in a large enterprise, and (ii) discuss potential avenues for carving sustainability into current software architecture practice.

Título: Chaos and Budworm Dynamics of Agent Interactions: A Biologically-Inspired Approach to Digital Ecosystems
Resumo: A primary motivation for research in digital ecosystems is the desire to exploit the self-organized properties of natural ecosystems. Ecosystems are thought to be robust, scalable architectures that can automatically solve complex, dynamic problems. However, the biological processes that contribute to these properties have not been made explicit in digital ecosystem research. Here, we discuss how biological properties contribute to the self-organized features of natural ecosystems. These properties include populations of evolving agents, a complex dynamic environment, and spatial distributions which generate local interactions. The potential for exploiting these properties is then considered. Theoretical and conceptually inspired from nature, the digital ecosystem could behave at large complex cycles of stability through alternate stable states. These approaches suggest that incorporating ideas from theoretical ecology can contribute to useful self-organized properties in digital ecosystems.

Título: Classification of Technical Debts in Software Development Using Text Analytics
Resumo: Technical debt refers to the technical trade-offs made by the software teams at the time of development of the software to fasten the delivery process. These trade-offs lead to a higher system maintenance cost, and it is difficult to often enhance the application. In some cases, enhancements can result in the entire modules being rewritten. So, in order to reduce the debt from the system, it is required to identify the debt and the project cycle where most of the debts occur. To automatically address this problem, this work uses the machine learning and text analytics model. Random forest and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms extract features from incident tracker documents and effectively classify the technical debts. The proposed technical debt classification model is made sustainable to handle the growing volumes of project documents by executing a distributed framework. The performance of both the models is examined, and it is found that SVM outperforms the other.

Título: Combining information centric and software defined networking to support command and control agility in military mobile networks
Resumo: Current military operations demand flexibility and adaptability due to the lack of communication infrastructure and the need for timely assertive decisions. To answer these challenges, we need to construct an efficient information dissemination mechanism to heterogeneous actors in the Battlefield Network (BN), which provides flexible and adaptable communications services to the military. Command and Control (C2) systems must sustain network-centric operations and guarantee C2 agility in situations in which the dynamics of the operational scenario require new network paradigms to deal with autonomous equipment, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), along with troopers and decision makers that need the right information at the right time. These entities constitute the Internet of Battle Things (IoBT), where the monitoring ability of smart things produces valuable information to be processed by peer-to-peer C2 applications. To address these issues, this work proposes a combination of Software Defined Networks (SDN) with Information Centric Networks (ICN) to meet the high level C2 requirements within deployed military mobile ad hoc networks. ICN provides an efficient data distribution mechanism and SDN controls the patterns of interaction among the IoBT heterogeneous nodes, as well as acts as an enabler for ICN to be integrated with the rest of the IP military cloud. A proof of concept of the architecture was implemented and compared with IP only and SDN-IP networks. The experiments performed to evaluate the implemented solution provided results showing a significant improvement of end-to-end delay and network load of the proposed architecture compared to conventional approaches.

Título: Comprehensive review of retinal blood vessel segmentation and classification techniques: intelligent solutions for green computing in medical images, current challenges, open issues, and knowledge gaps in fundus medical images
Resumo: Recently, there has been an advancement in the development of innovative computer-aided techniques for the segmentation and classification of retinal vessels, the application of which is predominant in clinical applications. Consequently, this study aims to provide a detailed overview of the techniques available for segmentation and classification of retinal vessels. Initially, retinal fundus photography and retinal image patterns are briefly introduced. Then, an introduction to the pre-processing operations and advanced methods of identifying retinal vessels is deliberated. In addition, a discussion on the validation stage and assessment of the outcomes of retinal vessels segmentation is presented. In this paper, the proposed methods of classifying arteries and veins in fundus images are extensively reviewed, which are categorized into automatic and semi-automatic categories. There are some challenges associated with the classification of vessels in images of the retinal fundus, which include the low contrast accompanying the fundus image and the inhomogeneity of the background lighting. The inhomogeneity occurs as a result of the process of imaging, whereas the low contrast which accompanies the image is caused by the variation between the background and the contrast of the various blood vessels. This means that the contrast of thicker vessels is higher than those that are thinner. Another challenge is related to the color changes that occur in the retina from different subjects, which are rooted in biological features. Most of the techniques used for the classification of the retinal vessels are based on geometric and visual characteristics that set the veins apart from the arteries. In this study, different major contributions are summarized as review studies that adopted deep learning approaches and machine learning techniques to address each of the limitations and problems in retinal blood vessel segmentation and classification techniques. We also review the current challenges, knowledge gaps and open issues, limitations and problems in retinal blood vessel segmentation and classification techniques.

Título: Computing Platforms for Large-Scale Multi-Agent Simulations: The Niche for Heterogeneous Systems
Resumo: A rapid shift of computing platforms for large-scale multi-agent simulation (MAS) towards higher parallelism using tools from simulation frameworks has made the impact of MAS logic on performance become transparent. This limits the perspective of developing MAS logic towards a sustained high performance direction. This paper presents a review of 62 works related to large-scale MASs published on Scopus from 2010 – April 2014. The review was compiled in three aspects (a) the recent direction of computing platforms, (b) the state of the art in simulation frameworks, and (c) the synergy between MAS logic and scalable performance achieved. The results confirm that the nature of dynamic interactions of autonomous agents among themselves, groups, and environments has most impact on performance of computing platforms. The analysis of the results shows the correspondence between the nature of MAS logic and the execution model of heterogeneous systems. This features heterogeneous systems as a promising platform for the even larger-scale MASs in the future.

Título: Conceptual Integration for Social-Ecological Systems
Resumo: Sustainability research and policy rely on complex data that couples social and ecological systems (SESs) to draw results and make decisions, therefore understanding the dynamics between human society and natural ecosystems is crucial to tackle sustainability goals. SESs frameworks are employed to establish a common vocabulary that facilitates the identification of variables and the comparison of results. A variety of SESs approaches have been proposed and explored, however integration and interoperability between frameworks is missing, which results in a loss of relevant information. In addition, SESs frameworks often lack semantic clarity which exacerbates difficulties in developing a unified perspective. In this paper we demonstrate the use of ontological analysis to unify the main elements of two prominent SESs paradigms, the social-ecological system framework (SESF) and the Ecosystem Services (ESs) approach, to build an integrated social-ecological perspectives framework. The proposed conceptual framework can be adopted to combine existent and future results from the two paradigms in unified databases and to develop broader explanatory and decision-making tools for SESs and sustainability research.

Título: Crowd logistics: an opportunity for more sustainable urban freight transport?
Resumo: Passenger car occupancy has been falling for years. Partly empty vehicles on our road networks decrease passenger transport sustainability but also contain an opportunity for freight transport. Within Crowd logistics (CL), delivery operations are carried out by using passengers’ excess capacity on journeys that are already taking place, resulting in economic, social and environmental benefits. Existing CL initiatives show, however, that there are important differences between concepts in terms of sustainability. The research aims to develop a suitable and comprehensive definition for CL and identify which factors determine the sustainability potential of CL.

Título: Data Driven Spatiotemporal Analysis of e-Cargo Bike Network in Lisbon and Its Expansion: The Yoob Case Study
Resumo: The adoption of more environmentally friendly and sustainable fleets for last-mile parcel delivery within large urban centers, such as e-cargo bikes, has gained the interest of the community. The logistics infrastructure network, had to adapt to the requirements of this new type of fleet, and micro-hubs and nano-hubs emerged. In this paper we tackle spatiotemporal characterization of e-cargo bike fleet behavior, by conducting a data centered case study where we explore data from Yoob, a last mile delivery e-cargo bike logistics startup that operates in the Lisbon area and outskirts. We also address the identification of potential expansion locations to the establishment of new hubs. Our data was collected during a 4-month period (January to April 2022). By adopting state-of-the-art data science and machine learning techniques, and following the CRIPS-DM data mining method, our innovative approach discovered five clusters that are able to characterize the Yoob fleet, with variations in distances traveled, times, transported volumes and speeds. In the perspective of expanding Yoob’s e-cargo bike network, three new locations in Lisbon were signaled for potential new hub installation. To the authors knowledge this is the first study of this kind carried in Portugal, bringing new insights in the field of last-mile logistics.

Título: Data-Driven Subtyping of Parkinson’s Using Acoustic Analysis of Sustained Vowels and Cluster Analysis: Findings in the Parkinson’s Voice Initiative Study
Resumo: People diagnosed with Parkinson’s (PwP) exhibit a diverse manifestation of heterogeneous symptoms which likely reflect different subtypes. However, there is no widely accepted consensus on the criteria for subtype membership assignment. We explored clustering PwP using a data-driven approach mining speech signals. We used data from the three English-speaking cohorts (Boston, Oxford, Toronto) in the Parkinson’s Voice Initiative (PVI), where speech and basic demographic information were collected over the standard telephone network. We acoustically characterized 2097 sustained vowel /a/ recordings from 1138 PwP (Boston cohort) using 307 dysphonia measures. We applied unsupervised feature selection to select a concise subset of the dysphonia measures and hierarchical clustering combined with 2D-data projections using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to facilitate visual exploration of PwP groups. We assessed cluster validity and consistency using silhouette plots and the cophenetic correlation coefficient. We externally validated cluster findings on the Oxford and Toronto PVI cohorts (n = 285 and 107 participants, respectively). We selected 21 dysphonia measures and found four main clusters which provide tentative insights into different dominating speech-associated characteristics (cophenetic coefficient = 0.72, silhouette score = 0.67). The cluster findings were consistent across the three PVI cohorts, strongly supporting the generalization of the presented methodology towards PwP subtype assignment, and were independently visually verified in 2D projections with t-SNE. The presented methodology with mining sustained vowels and clustering may provide an objective and streamlined approach towards informing PwP subtype assignment. This may have important implications towards developing more personalized clinical management of symptoms for PwP.

Título: Design Methodology for Construction of Mapping Applications
Resumo: Geoscientists and engineers use anomalies which are parts of a profile that is above or below the surrounding average to infer subsurface targets (groundwater, ore and petroleum). Customarily, they are detected by processing field measurements including geological and geophysical data using methods such as stacking (averaging), Fourier analysis and filtering. The issue is these methods often result in partial detection because they perform partial separation of wanted from unwanted anomalies and the error in separation gets propagated into data layers and subsequent analyses, thereby resulting in less accurate spatial predictions. In order to understand and address this issue, we investigate whether the design methodology for construction of mapping applications for characterizing geospatial variables achieves logical consistency of data layers and improve mapping accuracy of groundwater flow. We present a design methodology as an artifact and evaluated it by applying it to hydrogeological and geodetic data acquired from the Santa Clara Valley, CA, USA. The result shows that data parts offer distinctive patterns of geometric features that are signatures of groundwater flow for sustainable groundwater management. The practical implications of the result can be applied by software developers and data modelers, information systems and operations managers to construct logically consistent and well-composed environmental information systems.

After introducing the concept of EUDability, we outline the phases of the DEA methodology and how they should be iteratively performed. These phases rely on the study of several aspects of a sustainable digital transformation—among others: the domain of application, the work environment, and the ability of people to manage CT practices—and on the characterization of the EUD techniques that could be applied to support the modification, extension, and creation of digital artifacts.

Título: Developing Sustainable e-Business Models for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)
Resumo: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are technologies for efficient traffic management, e.g. accident and congestion prevention, reduced emissions, traveler information etc. Despite the potential benefits identified by previous research, there is a remarkable lack of a robust e-Business case for ITS. Although the necessary technology exists and the internet provides opportunities for more cost effective integration of systems and services, many ITS are not sustainable and great ideas do not develop further. Many applications are still too expensive to purchase and install, they require substantial upfront investments and the returns will take many years to materialize. This paper emphasizes the need for ITS to take advantage of the developments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the internet, and proposes some e-Business model framework for ITS. We also address sustainability issues and aspects of the network economy for ITS companies. Finally, we present a stakeholders’ analysis and a future research agenda.

Título: Development of computer science disciplines: a social network analysis approach
Resumo: In contrast to many other scientific disciplines, computer science considers conference publications. Conferences have the advantage of providing fast publication of papers and of bringing researchers together to present and discuss the paper with peers. Previous work on knowledge mapping focused on the map of all sciences or a particular domain based on ISI published Journal Citation Report (JCR). Although this data cover most of the important journals, it lacks computer science conference and workshop proceedings, which results in an imprecise and incomplete analysis of the computer science knowledge. This paper presents an analysis on the computer science knowledge network constructed from all types of publications, aiming at providing a complete view of computer science research. Based on the combination of two important digital libraries (DBLP and CiteSeerX), we study the knowledge network created at journal/conference level using citation linkage, to identify the development of sub-disciplines. We investigate the collaborative and citation behavior of journals/conferences by analyzing the properties of their co-authorship and citation subgraphs. The paper draws several important conclusions. First, conferences constitute social structures that shape the computer science knowledge. Second, computer science is becoming more interdisciplinary. Third, experts are the key success factor for sustainability of journals/conferences.

Resumo: Individually adapted and usable assistive technologies are one of the essential prerequisites for empowering people with disabilities. Although a growing number of devices and assistive technologies are available, the proportion of technology abandonment is still very high. This is due to various aspects, which in part lie in the assistive technology itself, in the characteristics of the users or in the psycho-social environment. The diverse contributions in this session show interesting approaches on how to further improve the development, evaluation, and assessment of assistive technologies. The presented results entail important advances in providing people with disabilities with the technology they need in a more suitable and sustainable way.

Título: Distributed and Heterogeneous Data Analysis for Smart Urban Planning
Resumo: Over the past decade, ‘smart’ cities have capitalized on new technologies and insights to transform their systems, operations and services. The rationale behind the use of these technologies is that an evidence-based, analytical approach to decision-making will lead to more robust and sustainable outcomes. However, harvesting high-quality data from the dense network of sensors embedded in the urban infrastructure, and combining this data with social network data, poses many challenges. In this paper, we investigate the use of an intelligent middleware – Device Nimbus – to support data capture and analysis techniques to inform urban planning and design. We report results from a ‘Living Campus’ experiment at the University of Melbourne, Australia focused on a public learning space case study. Local perspectives, collected via crowd sourcing, are combined with distributed and heterogeneous environmental sensor data. Our analysis shows that Device Nimbus’ data integration and intelligent modules provide high-quality support for decision-making and planning.

Título: DIY Homes: Placemaking in Rural Eco-Homes
Resumo: Eco-home makers are permaculturists, artists and environmentalists who actively engage with the environment and nature in order to build self-made, sustainable homes. Through the conceptual lens of “placemaking”, we draw on an ethnographic study of eco-home makers and focus on unpacking important lessons for sustainable HCI research. Engaging with 15 eco-home makers in rural Australia and China, we aim to develop an in-depth understanding of how and why they design, build and retrofit their eco-homes. Our findings show that eco-home makers apply a material-first approach, align their designs with nature and are influenced by sociality and everydayness of making. We conclude by discussing how such insights can deepen our understanding of placemaking and DIY in HCI, and open up new avenues for future design and research of computing tools to empower residents as place-makers, enabling them to make their own living environments sustainable.

Título: Do Cloud Computing Tools Support the Needs of Virtual Enterprises?
Resumo: Virtual Enterprise (VE) is a prominent strategy for leveraging new sustainable models to SMEs. A VE is as temporary network of enterprises that collaborate via the Internet towards achieving common goals, sharing assets, costs, risks and benefits. However, VE members do not use to share ICT assets and infrastructures in the collaboration. Cloud computing has emerged as option for that. Research works have developed prototypes and cloud-based environments to support very specific issues within given VE scenarios. However, it is important that SME managers have a broader perception about at which extent commercial cloud computing tools can indeed support the usual VE needs. This is the essential goal of this paper. The needs of VEs and performance indicators to evaluate cloud tools have been identified, and two commercial SaaS, PaaS and IaaS tools have been evaluated. Conclusions are provided in the end.

Título: Ecodesign Maturity Model: criteria for methods and tools classification
Resumo: Ecodesign is a strategic design activity established to conceive and develop sustainable solutions in line with the concept of life cycle thinking striving for environmental sustainability. Nowadays, the implementation of ecodesign practices into product-service systems (PSS) development processes, are difficult because the ecodesign practices are not systematized and also because the current maturity level of a company is not considered in the selection of practices to be applied. Depending on the maturity level in ecodesign application, there would exist some ecodesign practices that are more suitable than others. This paper presents the efforts that are being carried out in a cooperative project between Brazil and Germany (BRAGECRIM) to develop an Ecodesign Maturity Model to support the application of ecodesign practices in the development of remanufacturable production equipment. Specifically in this contribution, it will be presented the criteria that were used to classify the ecodesign methods and tools in order to support the selection of the most suitable ones according to the company maturity level and goals. During the systematic literature review, it was identified and classified 105 ecodesign methods and tools according to 13 criteria. The results and the state of the art of the ecodesign methods and tools are presented in this paper.

Título: Economic effects of low oil prices in Saudi Arabia
Resumo: During the last two decades, the oil prices have fluctuated between a high of $146 and a low of $28 per barrel. Oil has traditionally been regarded as a stable commodity in the worldwide market. However, the decline of oil prices during 2015-18 had hit the oil exporting countries very hard, which had pushed many countries to the brink of economic collapse or at least recession. As we can sense, oil prices are closely watched by policymakers, investors, and economists. Saudi Arabia is the largest exporter of the oil to many countries of our planet. The decline in energy prices had forced the Saudi Arabia government to incorporate structural, economic and fiscal reforms that focused on improving sustainability, transparency, project development and public finances in 2016 annual budget. This research study aims at investigating the economic effects of low oil prices and government austerity in Saudi Arabia. This study uses a case study approach, a questionnaire and analysis of its responses SPSS. A well-structured questionnaire was developed and distributed to different public offices, university students, shopping centers, and malls in Saudi Arabia. Also, this research has studied various databases and performed a systematic literature review of some articles and journals published between 2018 and 2019.

Título: Effectiveness and efficiency of a domain-specific language for high-performance marine ecosystem simulation: a controlled experiment
Resumo: It is a long-standing hypothesis that the concise and customized notation of a DSL improves the performance of developers when compared with a GPL. For non-technical domains—e.g., science—, this hypothesis lacks empirical evidence. Given this lack of empirical evidence, we evaluate a DSL for ecological modeling designed and implemented by us with regard to performance improvements of developers as compared to a GPL. We conduct an online survey with embedded controlled experiments among ecologists to assess the correctness and time spent of the participants when using a DSL for ecosystem simulation specifications compared with a GPL-based solution. We observe that (1) solving tasks with the DSL, the participants’ correctness point score was —depending on the task— on average 61 % up to 63 % higher than with the GPL-based solution and their average time spent per task was reduced by 31 % up to 56 %; (2) the participants subjectively find it easier to work with the DSL, and (3) more than 90 % of the subjects are able to carry out basic maintenance tasks concerning the infrastructure of the DSL used in our treatment, which is based on another internal DSL embedded into Java. The tasks of our experiments are simplified and our web-based editor components do not offer full IDE-support. Our findings indicate that the development of further DSL for the specific needs of the ecological modeling community should be a worthwhile investment to increase its members’ productivity and to enhance the reliability of their scientific results.

Título: Enabling Dynamic Capabilities through Agile IT and beyond Budgeting Practices
Resumo: This paper discusses the confluence of agile, lean and beyond budgeting approaches in the context of Enterprise IT solutions and presents a framework, which helps to achieve synergies from these approaches and avoid sub-optimizations. The paper suggests that lean and agile approaches cannot be used in a vacuum but need to be developed and considered in the context of other critical processes required to sustain and deliver enterprise IT solutions. While agile and lean methodologies certainly provide benefits they can deliver significantly more value when applied in collaboration with an overall dynamic capabilities (Teece et al, 2007) approach. The paper briefly introduces the ITCapability Maturity Framework (IT-CMF), (Curley, 2004, 2006) and considers a closed loop mechanism to enable a dynamic capability in the context of rapidly changing environments. The paper also presents a five-layer maturity model for managing the Enterprise IT budget which aligns to the principles of beyond budgeting (Hope and Fraser, 2003; Bosgnes, 2009) being considered in this conference.

Título: Enacting Innovation within Collaborative-Driven SOA Providers Networks
Resumo: Software industry has become a very important sector nowadays. New ICT paradigms have emerged to cope with current global-local world challenges, such as Service-oriented architecture (SOA). SOA has the potential to raise SMEs to new levels of sustainability in terms of software innovation. However, SMEs are limited in their resources, and both innovation and SOA are complex, costly and risky. This paper presents preliminary results of an ongoing research towards developing an innovation model that relies on collaboration, enabling software/SOA providers to work as an open network to jointly develop an innovative SOA-base software product. The proposed model identifies not only the processes to be involved in but also identifies the most relevant supporting issues to be taken into account along the innovation and collaboration processes. Final considerations about the work are presented at the end.

Título: Enterprise Agility: A Balancing Act - A Local Government Case Study
Resumo: Austerity and financial constraints have been threatening the public sector in the UK for a number of years. Foreseeing the threat of continued budget cuts, and addressing the situation many local councils face, requires internal transformations for financial stability without losing the key focus on public service. Agile transformations have been undertaken by organisations wanting to learn from the software development community and bringing agile principles into the wider organisation. This paper describes and analyses an ongoing behaviour-led transformation in a district council in the UK. It presents the results of the analysis of 19 interviews with internal stakeholders at the council, of observations of meetings among senior and middle management in a five-month period. The paper explores the successes and the challenges encountered towards the end of the transformation process and reflects on balancing acts to address the challenges, between: disruption and business as usual, empowerment and goal setting, autonomy and processes and procedures, and behaviours and skills. Based on our findings, we suggest that behaviours on their own cannot guarantee a sustained agile culture, and that this is equally important for enterprise agility and for large-scale agile software development transformations.

Título: Environmental sustainability in software process improvement: A systematic mapping study
Resumo: Sustainability is a main concern in our current society. One of the aspects that play an important role in supporting sustainable development is Information Technology (IT). Both software behavior and the way it is developed impact the amount of energy consumption. Thus, this paper aims to present the most recent approaches to address sustainability from a software process improvement perspective. A systematic mapping study was conducted to identify the latest efforts made in the IT field to improve sustainability. As a result, seven primary papers with initial ideas about how sustainability can be integrated into software processes were found. The lack of both proposals and empirical data suggests that further research on the topic is needed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

Título: Environmentally data-driven smart sustainable cities: applied innovative solutions for energy efficiency, pollution reduction, and urban metabolism
Resumo: The IoT and big data technologies have become essential to the functioning of both smart cities and sustainable cities, and thus, urban operational functioning and planning are becoming highly responsive to a form of data-driven urbanism. This offers the prospect of building models of smart sustainable cities functioning in real time from routinely sensed data. This in turn allows to monitor, understand, analyze, and plan such cities to improve their energy efficiency and environmental health in real time thanks to new urban intelligence functions as an advanced form of decision support. However, prior studies tend to deal largely with data-driven technologies and solutions in the realm of smart cities, mostly in relation to economic and social aspects, leaving important questions involving the underlying substantive and synergistic effects on environmental sustainability barely explored to date. These issues also apply to sustainable cities, especially eco-cities. Therefore, this paper investigates the potential and role of data-driven smart solutions in improving and advancing environmental sustainability in the context of smart cities as well as sustainable cities, under what can be labeled “environmentally data-driven smart sustainable cities.” To illuminate this emerging urban phenomenon, a descriptive/illustrative case study is adopted as a qualitative research methodology§ to examine and compare Stockholm and Barcelona as the ecologically and technologically leading cities in Europe respectively. The results show that smart grids, smart meters, smart buildings, smart environmental monitoring, and smart urban metabolism are the main data-driven smart solutions applied for improving and advancing environmental sustainability in both eco-cities and smart cities. There is a clear synergy between such solutions in terms of their interaction or cooperation to produce combined effects greater than the sum of their separate effects—with respect to the environment. This involves energy efficiency improvement, environmental pollution reduction, renewable energy adoption, and real-time feedback on energy flows, with high temporal and spatial resolutions. Stockholm takes the lead over Barcelona as regards the best practices for environmental sustainability given its long history of environmental work, strong environmental policy, progressive environmental performance, high environmental standards, and ambitious goals. It also has, like Barcelona, a high level of the implementation of applied data-driven technology solutions in the areas of energy and environment. However, the two cities differ in the nature of such implementation. We conclude that city governments do not have a unified agenda as a form of strategic planning, and data-driven decisions are unique to each city, so are environmental challenges. Big data are the answer, but each city sets its own questions based on what characterize it in terms of visions, policies, strategies, pathways, and priorities.

Título: Evaluating the accessibility of a PoN-enabled misuse case notation by the red–green colorblind community
Resumo: In 2015, an improved version of the misuse case modeling notation designed using the Physics of Notations (PoN) framework was proposed. Empirical data support that the new notation is more cognitively effective than the original notation. The new notation makes use of color, in particular, red and green, meaning that red–green colorblind community will not be able to view the notation as designed and intended. The cognitive effectiveness of the red–green deficient (RGD) version of the new notation in comparison to the original notation is unknown. The PoN outlines a number of principles that can be satisfied with or without the use of color, but would the deficiency of color may be so inhibiting that the cognitive effectiveness superiority of the PoN-enabled misuse case notation becomes diminished? Perhaps the original use case notation would be more cognitively effective for red–green colorblind users. An empirical study using 84 IT (Information Technology) professionals is conducted to assess the cognitive effectiveness of the RGD version of the PoN-enabled misuse case notation in comparison to the original misuse case notation. The experiment data are analyzed for any statistically significant findings. The quantitative and qualitative results of the experiment indicate that the RGD version of PoN-enabled misuse case notation maintains its cognitive effectiveness superiority over the original notation. The results also show that the subjects are divided in their opinions with respect to the aesthetic appeal of the two notations. Adhering to the complete set of principles outlined in the PoN has allowed the new notation to maintain its cognitive effectiveness superiority over the original notation despite a curtailed color perspective.

Título: Event Detection over Continuous Data Stream for the Sustainable Growth in Agriculture Context
Resumo: The coordination failure is a concept that explains the failure of people to coordinate and act on a real-world problem properly. The failure of coordination among human communities can lead to social problems in many domains including in transportation, health care, disaster management, agriculture etc. and ultimately affects the sustainable growth of a country as a whole. The recent advancements in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have introduced a new trend called Collaborative Consumption - the peer-to-peer based coordination and sharing of information through online by human communities has been expected to solve these social problems identified in the above domains. The tremendous adaptation of people towards ICTs ultimately resulted in huge, fast-moving and heterogeneous data contributed by people in a collaborative manner. In here, most of these data describe real-time events associated with the people based on their context. The way of coordinating user communities to contribute data, detecting events from it and effective delivery of required information to needful parties would be a possible solution to overcome the coordination problem. In this paper, the result of a systematic literature review is performed to understand the current state of the event detection methods used in information systems. Furthermore, we have proposed a user centered mobile based information system that assists the detection of pest outbreak events in agriculture domain for an effective and timely delivery of actionable information to farmers.

Título: Exploring How Tangible Tools Enable Collaboration in a Multi-touch Tabletop Game
Resumo: Digital tabletop surfaces afford multiple user interaction and collaboration. Hybrid tabletops that include both tangible and multi-touch elements are increasingly being deployed in public settings (e.g. Microsoft Surface, reacTable). Designers need to understand how the different characteristics of tangible and multi-touch interface elements affect collaborative activity on tabletops. In this paper, we report on a mixed methods exploratory study of a collaborative tabletop game about sustainable development. We explore the effects of tangible and multi-touch tools on collaborative activity. Forty-five participants, in trios, played the game using both versions of the tools. Our analysis includes quantitative performance measures, qualitative themes and behavioral measures. Findings suggest that both tangible and multi-touch tools enabled effective tool use and that collaborative activity was more influenced by group dynamics than tool modality. However, we observed that the physicality of the tangible tools facilitated individual ownership and announcement of tool use, which in turn supported group and tool awareness.

The study aims at providing an overview of existing research in this area and identify gaps and limitations in literature, especially in between smart meter literature and how consumers perceive smart meters. Through a scoping review process, 16 articles were selected for analysis. The findings highlight the importance of real-time information, remote monitoring, accuracy, privacy, and security in smart meter functionality. The benefits encompass improved customer awareness, energy efficiency, and grid stability, while the drawbacks include privacy concerns and limitations in current standards. Factors influencing adoption include cost-benefit analysis, regulatory policies, consumer awareness, and technical considerations. The study reveals research gaps related to long-term performance, social and psychological factors, diverse consumer segments, privacy and data security, economic viability, regional contexts, and stakeholder dynamics. Addressing these gaps will contribute to maximizing benefits of smart meters, informing policymakers, utility companies, and researchers for effective strategies in energy management and sustainability. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research and underscores the need to understand consumers’ perspectives on smart meters.

Título: Exploring Sustainability in Real Cases of Emerging Small-to-Medium Enterprises Ecosystems
Resumo: The effort and costs required to maintain complex software systems in the modern, global industry are often high, involving continuous refactoring to ensure longevity in the face of changing requirements. As such, it is challenging to treat systems sustainability as a quality requirement. This fact has been particularly challenging with the emergence of software ecosystems (SECO). A SECO is a set of actors that interact with a marketplace distributed between software and services and supported by a common technological platform. In this work, three real cases of SECO were modeled by applying a framework for systems sustainability to better understand the influence of such requirement. We also used a set of ecosystem factors that facilitate the understanding of the existing relationships in each SECO. The produced models were submitted to expert reviews based on a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews to understand and validate the analysis. Results indicate the difficulty in treating sustainability as a requirement due to lack of research on the topic, but highlight the importance of analyzing this requirement to assist in the SECO evolution.

Título: Exploring the energy informatics and energy citizenship domains: a systematic literature review
Resumo: To effectively address the challenges posed by the increasing share of the energy sector in global greenhouse effects, the domains of energy informatics and energy citizenship play a critical role. Energy informatics aims at using information systems and channels to reduce energy consumption. However, there is a realization that the challenges posed by global greenhouse effects cannot be catered to alone by the energy information systems. Therefore, there is a need for engaging human inhabitants to actively engage toward more sustainable means (i.e., energy citizenship) thus reducing the energy sector’s share in the global greenhouse effect. This paper presents a systematic literature review (SLR) after analysis of (n = 115) articles on the topic to identify (i) the themes considered in energy informatics and energy citizenship domains, and (ii) the interconnection between energy informatics and energy citizenship domains, (iii) energy information needs among stakeholders which establish a clear interconnect with energy citizenship. These identified themes and their interconnections are critical for energy researchers, policymakers, and energy businesses to identify relevant research topics, identify energy consumers’ needs, and create just energy transition policies. The paper additionally summarizes the gaps in the state of the art by mentioning the open research questions that arise due to the identified interconnection between energy informatics and energy citizenship.

Título: Exploring the software quality criteria and sustainable development targets: A case study of digital library in malaysian higher learning institution
Resumo: Being sustainable within social, environmental, and the economy is still a major issue to almost every company globally. Although on-going actions have been implemented via information and communication technology (ICT), studies and development efforts in seeking solutions are in scarcity, particularly for the present use of software to perform its intended task. The lack of technological innovation and development motivate us to explore the present use of software with the focus on software quality criteria (SQC) in attaining sustainable development targets (SDTs). The understanding of SQC is significant for the purpose of meeting the needs and operating environment of software that are continually changed in the future. This paper presents a semi-structured interview involving eight digital library’s stakeholders in one of Malaysian higher learning institution. By applying thematic analysis, the study finds six digital library software quality criteria (DL-SQC) and seven digital library sustainable development targets (DL-SDTs) that were heavily stressed by more than half of participants. The DL-SQC are usability, maintainability, functionality, portability, efficiency, and reliability. While the DL-SDTs are equal access to information/knowledge, energy efficiency, persistent updates the information/knowledge, collaboration & partnership, funding, green technology innovation, and information/knowledge sharing. The study contributes as a guide to researchers who are motivated to position their further studies into this topic and for a practitioner; it is to summarize the SQC and their relevant SDTs that may be applied to make decisions regarding the next level of software development and maintenance process towards being sustainable. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

Título: Extending ISO/IEC 29110 with Sustainability Tasks
Resumo: Sustainability is an aspect to be considered by software development organizations because it is believed that software systems are means to support sustainable development. Currently, few processes, methods and tools exist to practice sustainability design within software engineering, and they are scattered across different application domains and life cycle stages. With the purpose of providing a set of practices in order to address sustainability goals during software development, this paper proposes a set of sustainability tasks to be implemented by very small software organizations. The tasks were derived from literature containing sustainability practices. The latter were organized as tasks and integrated into the ISO/IEC 29110 Basic Profile processes: project management and software implementation. The proposed sustainability tasks were initially validated against two previously reported studies on environmentally sustainable software development.

Título: Extending Traceability Technique to Client Forensic Investigation
Resumo: The easy accessibility of stored data on the cloud storage with the use of wide range of digital devices offers both the economic and technical opportunities to its subscribers. These benefits can also be exploited by malicious users to carry out illegal activities. When such illegal activities (cybercrimes) are carried out, it is essential for digital forensic investigators to identify the malicious usages, the dynamics of the crime, identify the perpetrators or the individuals behind the crime, reconstruct the crime patterns, interpret the criminal activities and charge the personalities involved to the court of law. The sustainability of digital forensics depends on the use of appropriate technology to curb various forms of cybercrimes. During forensic investigation artificial intelligence techniques and the use of appropriate forensic tools play important roles to detect activities related to cybercrime. One of the technical challenges associated with cloud forensics investigation is the inability of forensic investigators to obtain raw data from the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) as a result of privacy issue; this necessitates the need for client forensics. The aim of this paper is to propose a model based on traceability technique to illustrate how the extracted digital artifacts from Windows 10 and an android smartphone can be mapped and linked to the cloud storage accessed and to illustrate the patterns of the activities with 5Ws1H-based expression (what, who, where, when, why and how). The model is set out to assist forensic investigators to easily identify, track and reconstruct a post-event timeline of the activities that takes place on cloud storage with the use of client devices and thereby saves time and enhances better visualization of the crime patterns.

Título: FORE-Watch – The Clock That Tells You When to Use: Persuading Users to Align Their Energy Consumption with Green Power Availability
Resumo: Besides saving energy, using it at the right time (i.e. when there is a supply surplus, and the power is produced by sustainable power sources such as hydroelectricity or wind) is an important possibility to achieve positive effects for the environment. To enable the user to align their behavior with the dynamics of the energy generation they need to be informed about the current status of power supply and grid capacity. Furthermore, to be able to plan their behavior and possibly delay or advance consumption activities to more proper moments they also need to have access to high-quality forecasts about the future status of green energy supply. In this paper we present an ambient display design solution based on a common watch that is optimized for providing this information in an unobtrusive, ambient and persuasive way. We present and discuss requirements identified by use of literature analysis, focus groups and end-user questionnaires, outline approaches to calculate basic power generation forecasts based on weather forecast data and present an ambient interface concept designed to meet the identified requirements. We conclude that the developed approach has high potential to support desired behavior changes, and that achieving acceptable accuracy levels for the generation forecast is feasible with relatively little effort.

Título: From Digitization to Digital Collaborative Service Designs: A Systematic Literature Review on the Categories, Concepts and Constructs of Industry 5.0
Resumo: In the last decade, business and industry put major emphasis on the digitization of its infrastructures, resources, processes and business models. In doing so, managers and organizational decision makers experienced support and guidance from the so-called Industry 4.0 paradigm. At the beginning of the year 2021, the European Commission launched the Industry 5.0 paradigm, an approach, that in comparison to Industry 4.0, puts human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience at the heart of the ongoing digital transition. However, the concept of Industry 5.0 still remains vague. This systematic literature review at hand builds upon this lack of knowledge and inductively investigates into the categories, concepts, and constructs of Industry 5.0. By the use of the Grounded Theory Methodology, a representative sample size of scholarly papers has been analyzed and coded. This process resulted in the emergence of the five categories Governance, Humanness, Technology, Intelligence & proficiency, and Environment. These categories as well as its related concepts and constructs are recognized as the main fields of action in Industry 5.0.

Título: Future Research Agenda to Understanding the Sustainable Business Model in Industry 4.0
Resumo: All over the world, Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and Sustainable Development (SD) have progressively gained the interest of scholars, politicians, and other parts of society. Besides beings two of the most debated topics of the last decades; they also have overlaps between their independent research fields. Some examples are reductions of environmental impacts and improvements in production technologies. This integration of technologies and sustainable advances within an industrial context can enable a set of important competitiveness forces, which results can reflect in business improvement. However, the link between I4.0, SD, and business still needs a broader understanding. Basing on this perspective, this paper proposes a systematic literature review (2015–2020) to identify the current state of research on the subject by mapping and summarising existing research efforts, as well as identifying research agendas, gaps, and opportunities for more development. Results point to that there are fourteen research opportunities, showing the potential of Industry 4.0 as an enabler of sustainable business models that changes the responsibilities of companies.

Título: Gamification suffers from the novelty effect but benefits from the familiarization effect: Findings from a longitudinal study
Resumo: There are many claims that gamification (i.e., using game elements outside games) impact decreases over time (i.e., the novelty effect). Most studies analyzing this effect focused on extrinsic game elements, while fictional and collaborative competition have been recently recommended. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, no long-term research has been carried out with STEM learners from introductory programming courses (CS1), a context that demands encouraging practice and mitigating motivation throughout the semester. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to better understand how the impact of a gamification design, featuring fictional and competitive-collaborative elements, changes over a 14-week period of time, when applied to CS1 courses taken by STEM students (N = 756). In an ecological setting, we followed a 2x7 quasi-experimental design, where Brazilian STEM students completed assignments in either a gamified or non-gamified version of the same system, which provided the measures (number of attempts, usage time, and system access) to assess user behavior at seven points in time. Results indicate changes in gamification’s impact that appear to follow a U-shaped pattern. Supporting the novelty effect, the gamification’s effect started to decrease after four weeks, decrease that lasted between two to six weeks. Interestingly, the gamification’s impact shifted to an uptrend between six and 10 weeks after the start of the intervention, partially recovering its contribution naturally. Thus, we found empirical evidence supporting that gamification likely suffers from the novelty effect, but also benefits from the familiarization effect, which contributes to an overall positive impact on students. These findings may provide some guidelines to inform practitioners about how long the initial contributions of gamification last, and how long they take to recover after some reduction in benefits. It can also help researchers to realize when to apply/evaluate interventions that use gamification by taking into consideration the novelty effect and, thereby, better understand the real impact of gamification on students’ behavior in the long run.

Título: Gender Equality in Information Technology Processes: A Systematic Mapping Study
Resumo: Information Technology (IT) plays a key role in the world we live in. As such, its relation to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) stated by the United Nations to improve lives and health of the people and the planet is inexorable. In particular, the SDG 5 aims to enforce gender equality and states 9 Targets that drive the actions to achieve such goals. The lack of women within IT has been a concern for several years. In this context, the objective of this study is to get an overview of the state of the art on gender equality in IT processes. To do so, we conducted a Systematic Mapping Study to investigate the addressed targets, challenges, and potential best practices that have been put forward so far. The results we have obtained demonstrate the novelty of this field, as well as a set of opportunities and challenges that currently exist in this regard, such as the lack of best practices to address gender equality in IT processes and the need to develop proposals that solve this problem. All of this can be used as a starting point to identify open issues that help to promote research on this field and promote and enhance best practices towards a more socially sustainable basis for gender equality in and by IT.

Título: Green cloud computing adoption challenges and practices: a client’s perspective-based empirical investigation
Resumo: Over the last decade, the widespread adoption of cloud computing has spawned a new branch of the computing industry known as green cloud computing. Cloud computing is improving, and data centers are increasing at regular frequencies to meet the demands of users. On the other hand, cloud providers pose major environmental risks because massive data centers use a large amount of energy and leave a carbon footprint. One possible solution to this issue is the use of green cloud computing. However, clients face significant difficulties in adopting green cloud computing. This study aims to understand the problems faced by client organizations while considering green cloud computing. In addition, this study aims to empirically identify the solution to the challenges faced by green cloud computing practitioners. A questionnaire survey approach was used to get insight into green cloud computing practitioners concerning the challenges they faced and their solutions. Data were obtained from sixty-nine professionals in green cloud computing. The results revealed that “lack of quality of service”, “lack of dynamic response”, and “lack of services to satisfy client’s requirements” are critical for green cloud computing. In addition, sixty-three practices for addressing the challenges in green cloud computing are also identified. The identified challenges and practices of green cloud computing will benefit the client organizations to update and revise their process to consider green cloud computing. In addition, it will also assist vendor organizations in developing, planning, and managing systems concerning client satisfaction.

Título: Green IS for GHG Emission Reporting on Product-Level? An Action Design Research Project in the Meat Industry
Resumo: Greenhouse gas emission reporting gained importance in the last years, due to societal and governmental pressure. However, this task is highly complex, especially in interdependent batch production processes and for reporting on the product-level. Green information systems, which collect, process and enhance the environmental information basis, are seen as a possible solution for this complex task, but only few Green IS accrued in IS research and practice. In this paper, we present initial results from an action design science research project. We studied three meat processing companies and developed a Green IS artifact that is capable to collect, process and report energy consumption and GHG emissions on product and process level. The evaluation for two sausage products shows that the artifact enhances the information basis with more detailed data towards average calculations, enabling more sustainable business processes. Finally, we propose design principles for the class of environmental accounting on product-level.

Título: Green-Tao Numbers and SAT
Resumo: We aim at using the problems from exact Ramsey theory, concerned with computing Ramsey-type numbers, as a rich source of test problems for SAT solving, targeting especially hard problems. Particularly we consider the links between Ramsey theory in the integers, based on van der Waerden’s theorem, and (boolean, CNF) SAT solving. Based on Green-Tao’s theorem (“the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions”) we introduce the Green-Tao numbers grtmk1, ..., km, which in a sense combine the strict structure of van der Waerden problems with the quasi-randomness of the distribution of prime numbers. In general the problem sizes become quickly infeasible here, but we show that for transversal extensions these numbers only grow linearly, thus having a method at hand to produce more problem instances of feasible sizes. Using standard SAT solvers (look-ahead, conflict-driven, and local search) we determine the basic Green-Tao numbers. It turns out that already for this single case of a Ramsey-type problem, when considering the best-performing solvers a wide variety of solver types is covered. This is different to van der Waerden problems, where apparently only simple look-ahead solvers succeed (regarding complete methods). For m > 2 the problems are non-boolean, and we introduce the generic translation scheme for translating non-boolean clause-sets to boolean clause-set. This general method offers an infinite variety of translations (“encodings”) and covers the known methods. In most cases the special instance called nested translation proved to be far superior over its competitors (including the direct translation).

Título: GreenCommute: An Influence-Aware Persuasive Recommendation Approach for Public-Friendly Commute Options
Resumo: Negative impacts produced by transportation sector have increased in parallel with the increase of urban mobility. In this paper, we introduce GreenCommute, a novel recommendation system which can facilitate commuters to take public friendly commute options, while provide support to alleviate the external cost in society, such as traffic pollution, congestion and accidents. In the meanwhile, a rewarding mechanism for persuading commuters is embedded in the proposed approach for balancing the conflict between personal needs and social aims. The allocation of reward values also takes users’ influential degrees in the social network into consideration. Experimental results show that the GreenCommute can promote public friendly commute options more effectively in comparison to the traditional recommendation system.

Título: Guidelines for developing geographically sensitive mobile health applications
Resumo: Seventeen (17) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were promulgated in 2016 following the end of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) era. SDG 3 aims to ensure health lives and promote well-being for all ages. Increasing use of geo-enabled mobile health applications can positively contribute to the realisation of SDG 3 targets. Health facilities and the communities that require health care are connected by geography. Digital technologies are increasingly becoming an important resource for health service delivery and public health. However, there is need for a framework that guide the development and deployment of context relevant location based digital technologies. This paper presents recommendations for guidelines that can be adopted for developing geographically sensitive mobile health applications. These guidelines were formulated based on experience from the RoadMApp project in Kwekwe District of Zimbabwe. RoadMApp is an mHealth location aware application that reduces the negative effects of long travel times to health care facilities by pregnant women. The developed guidelines for developing geographically sensitive mobile applications start with user requirements assessment followed by geographic information systems data needs and modelling then database development, and finally frontend mobile application development. In line with the new global health policy drive for locally driven and context relevant health interventions, the guidelines present new opportunities that take advantage of the ubiquity of mobile telephony and could be adopted in health policy formulations to contribute to SDG3.

Título: How Scrum adds value to achieving software quality?
Resumo: Scrum remains the most popular agile software development method implementation for a variety of reasons; one important motive is to improve software quality. Yet many organizations fail to achieve quality improvements through the use of Scrum, and existing research sheds little light on the value-add of Scrum for software quality. More specifically, (1) how notions of software quality among Scrum practitioners relate to established quality perspectives, (2) how Scrum helps teams to achieve higher software quality and (3) why some teams fail to meet the objective of higher quality. We addressed these gaps through a two-phased qualitative study based on 39 interviews and two in-depth case studies. We find that Scrum practitioners emphasize established notions of external quality comprising of conformity to business needs and absence of defects, while they also value internal quality, especially sustainable software design. Our results show that Scrum helps teams achieve both dimensions of quality by promoting some social antecedents (collaboration, psychological safety, accountability, transparency) and process-induced advantages (iterative development, formal inspection, and adaptation). Our findings unveil how these factors contribute to achieving software quality and under what conditions their effects can fail to materialize. These conditions include inconsistent Scrum implementations, cultural constraints, team tensions, and inaccessibility of end-users. In addition, the complexity of the project aggravates the impact of these conditions. Taken together, these findings show that Scrum can complement established quality assurance and software engineering practices by promoting a social environment that is conducive to creating high-quality software. Based on our findings, we provide specific recommendations for how practitioners can create such an environment.

Título: Identifying the Constructs and Agile Capabilities of Data Governance and Data Management: A Review of the Literature
Resumo: Data has become an invaluable asset to organisations. However, it is evident from the existing literature that despite the increased awareness of the importance of their data assets, many organisations fail to manage and govern these assets with the agility required in a highly competitive and volatile business environment. For data governance to be effective and sustainable in a turbulent, increasingly regulated and competitive organisational environment, all of the elements of data governance should enable and support agility in the organisation’s management of its data and information assets. As a result of increased local and global data regulations, a high reliance on technical skills, and economic constraints, organisations in developing countries have experienced challenges with implementing data governance programs. Governance within an organisation comprises the internal processes and policies that enable human capital performance, legal and regulatory compliance, and organisational alignment. There is no single approach to achieving successful data governance, and factors pertaining to the organisation’s strategy, structure, business requirements and culture need to be considered. In this study, a systematic review of existing academic literature was conducted to investigate (1) the scope and constructs of data governance and data management, (2) the agile capabilities that are required in data governance and data management for the timeous delivery of useful data to business, and (3) the need for African organisations to establish agile capabilities in their data governance and data management functions. The results of this review should be helpful with assisting organisations in African countries to achieve agility in the governance and management of data, that supports business requirements and organisational agility.

Título: Improving the Sustainability of SOA Providers’ Networks via a Collaborative Process Innovation Model
Resumo: Companies from the software sector have been seeking new, sustainable business models. A key strategy to achieve is innovation. Being a sector largely formed by SMEs, a general problem is to keep innovation a sustainable practice. Many companies have been shifting their systems’ architectures to SOA, but despite its potentials, SOA projects are often costly, complex and risky. One approach to mitigate this is endowing companies with means to innovate collaboratively. Current innovation models are mostly devoted to the manufacturing sector, without supporting the many software and SOA specificities. We present a collaborative innovation process model as a contribution to fill this gap. The model combines open and network innovation approaches and allowing the tailoring of process composition to accommodate the uniqueness of innovation projects. The proposed model was evaluated by industry.

Título: INCUVA: A Meta-framework for Sustaining the Value of Innovation in Multi-cultural Settings
Resumo: Innovation is increasingly seen as the main vehicle for value creation in business organisations as well as in civic societies. Consequently, funding agencies and businesses continue to invest huge amounts of money and other resources on innovative projects with a view to creating and sustaining the desired value outcomes. However, creating value is not the same as sharing and sustaining value, especially when such value needs to be shared and sustained in a multicultural space. This paper analyses the interaction of three key elements, namely Innovation, Culture and Value, that could facilitate or inhibit the sharing and sustenance of value created through innovative projects. The paper also proposes a meta–framework based on work done during the EU-funded project VALO, aimed at developing and disseminating effective ways of maximising and sustaining the value created in innovative projects.

Título: Indicators to Evaluate Elements of Industry 5.0 in the Textile Production of MSMEs
Resumo: Textile MSMEs are going through a period of instability and greater difficulty in executing their operations due to factors derived from the pandemic, globalization, policies, and environmental and social needs. This is driving companies to abandon classic methods and turn to the use of innovative concepts as manners to promote sustainability and resilience. One of these concepts is Industry 5.0, which, according to the European Commission, focuses on sustainable manufacturing and operator well-being and complements Industry 4.0 as it seeks to improve factory efficiency through technology by placing the human being at the center of development. At the same time, it minimizes environmental and social impacts and enhances resilience. Aware that implementing these new trends is a challenge for MSMEs, this study contributes to the generation of indicators to evaluate elements of Industry 5.0 in the textile production of MSMEs, supporting the development and implementation of strategies focused on this area. The construction of the set of indicators is based on a 3-phase framework that consists of doing a systematic literature review, selecting the indicators by a process of analysis and comparison, and expanding their characteristics through elaborating data sheets. As part of the results, 172 indicators completed a rigorous selection and validation process. These will serve as the basis for developing sustainable, resilient, and human-centered production models that can be carried out in future research.

Título: Integrating X-reality and lean into end-of-life aircraft parts disassembly sequence planning: a critical review and research agenda
Resumo: In parallel with the fast growth of the second-hand aviation market, the importance of promoting remanufacturing analytics has increased. However, end-of-life (EoL) aircraft parts remanufacturing operations are still underdeveloped. Disassembly, the most challenging and central activity in remanufacturing, directly affects the EoL product recovery’s profitability and sustainability. Disassembly sequence planning (DSP) devises ordered and purposeful parting for all potentially recoverable components before physical separations. However, the complexities and uncertainties of the EoL conditions engender unpredictable DSP decision inputs. The EoL DSP needs emergent evidence of cost-effective solutions in view of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) implications and stakeholders’ benefits. Among the I4.0 technologies, X-reality (XR) particularly hits the mainstream as a cognitive and visual tool consisting of virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality. Recently, with the advance of I4.0 phenomenon, lean management has been theorized and tested through complementary collaboration. Since the research of integrating lean and XR into the EoL DSP is underexplored in literature, XR and lean are investigated as assistive enablers in the DSP. This study has a two-fold purpose: (1) identifying the key concepts of DSP, I4.0, XR, and lean, and extending the literature by reviewing the previous efforts of EoL aircraft remanufacturing, XR-assisted DSP, and XR–lean applications; (2) proposing “Smart Disassembly Sequence Planning (SDSP)” as a new EoL decision-support agenda after analyzing relational advantages and evolving adaptability. The barriers and limitations are highlighted from the recent associated topics, concrete academic information for developing digitalized disassembly analytics is provided, and new trends are added for future disassembly research.

Título: Kinetic Architecture and BIM: The State of Art and Future Visions
Resumo: Kinetic architecture is the design of buildings or building systems with transformative elements using mechanical components. Recent developments in construction technology, robotics, design computing and material science have increased the interest and demand for kinetic building systems and applications. This motivation relates to the growing need for functional flexibility, adaptability, sustainability and extended capabilities of structural performance. Although the concept of kinetic architecture is not new in architectural theory and practice for a few decades, it has not been sufficiently discussed in the context of Building Information Modeling (BIM) methods. Most studies in the related literature only focus on the parametric design and modeling of kinetic façade systems in a supportive parametric design tool and synchronous or nonsynchronous integration of these models into the BIM environment as 3D objects or families. Although these applications with BIM and parametric design tools have significant potentials, a large number of recent studies ignore the essential concepts of kinetic architecture and critical aspects of the kinetic design, simulation and analysis processes. In order to meet these deficiencies, this paper provides a comprehensive investigation of BIM methods in the milieu of kinetic design applications along with a suggestive object-oriented ontological framework and holistic integrative strategies. The arguments are based on the parametric modeling and simulation of kinetic systems, subsystems and components, as they are similar to parametric product models in other manufacturing engineering disciplines. The paper includes the following: (1) a critical review of the existing approaches of BIM methods and parametric applications for kinetic architecture (2) a thorough discussion of holistic BIM integration strategies for kinetic building systems with well-reasoned arguments along with theoretical and practical perspectives.

Título: Knowledge Management as a Sustainable Development Supporting Method in Manufacturing Organizations – A Systematic Literature Review
Resumo: The importance of knowledge management (KM) is rising in every mature company as well as it is widely discussed in the literature. Many papers were published in order to discuss KM in different contexts. The aim of this work is to review and analyze literature which is connected to KM. The authors treat KM as a supporting method for sustainable development (SD) of a manufacturing system in terms of economic, environmental and social aspects. A systematic literature review was performed according to the developed research methodology, which covers research questions and keywords identification, selection and exclusion criteria and results analysis. The search was performed with the use of keywords such as knowledge management, manufacturing organization as well as sustainable development and their modifications. Afterwards, quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed. In the quantitative analysis the criteria such as a number of papers published in different years, in different journals and conference materials were used to illustrate the published works. A deeper analysis was performed on the basis of the author keywords, abstracts and full texts where available. The main goal of this paper was to analyze how deeply the aspects which concern KM and SD are discussed in the publications connected with manufacturing companies. The presented work is a part of wider research connected with the effective implementation of KM in manufacturing areas. Social aspects were identified as the least discussed in the literature and they need future studies. Additionally, the IT system to support KM and application of such emerging technologies as data mining, Augmented Reality, Internet of Things and Blockchain and Edge Computing can be further investigated in the context of SD.

Título: Knowledge Management for the Digital Transformation of Enterprises – Literature Based Trend Analysis
Resumo: The digital transformation of companies and society is progressing. The rapid realization of projects or the accelerated implementation of new “disruptive” technologies endanger aspects of sustainability. A sustainable aspect can be seen in the knowledge management of companies: The digital transformation, new technologies and the new production factor knowledge are putting established models for knowledge management under pressure. This paper presents the current state of research on knowledge management in relation to digital transformation. It could be worked out that knowledge management must gain more importance in companies. The way in which knowledge management is operated is changing at the same time, which makes new rules necessary. Due to the plurality of concepts and models, knowledge management is difficult to apply holistically for companies. Enterprises experience a technological upgrading which makes learning of the organization together with technology and humans possible. New forms of access to knowledge enable more target-oriented access in each situation.

Título: KPIs for Software Ecosystems: A Systematic Mapping Study
Resumo: To create value with a software ecosystem (SECO), a platform owner has to ensure that the SECO is healthy and sustainable. Key Performance Indicators (KPI) are used to assess whether and how well such objectives are met and what the platform owner can do to improve. This paper gives an overview of existing research on KPI-based SECO assessment using a systematic mapping of research publications. The study identified 34 relevant publications for which KPI research and KPI practice were extracted and mapped. It describes the strengths and gaps of the research published so far, and describes what KPI are measured, analyzed, and used for decision-making from the researcher’s point of view. For the researcher, the maps thus capture state-of-knowledge and can be used to plan further research. For practitioners, the generated map points to studies that describe how to use KPI for managing of a SECO.

Título: Latent factors on the design and adoption of gamified apps in primary education
Resumo: The main objective of this research is to determine the perception of teachers about the elements that increases the educational effectiveness of gamified apps in primary education. A methodology based on an importance-performance analysis was daeveloped, using a structural equations model to calcuate the degree of importance of each variable. The sample was formed of 212 Spanish teachers with experience using educational apps in the teaching–learning process. Six categories were identified as precursors of educational effectiveness: (1) curriculum connection, (2) feedback and operational experience, (3) assessment and learning analytics, (4) sustainability (Protection Personal data), (5) equal access and (6) flow. These six categories enhance the three traditional areas of gamification intervention: cognitive, emotional and social. In this sense, the design and adoption of an educational gamified app should: (1) establish a clear link between the game and curricular content and competence development; (2) promote self-regulated learning through individual and collaborative activities; (3) offer adapted learning by integrating differentiated personalized learning pathways; (4) integrate learning analytics that can be consulted by teacher, student and family; (5) comply with data protection regulation and promote a safe, sustainable and ethical use of the information generated; (6) take into account different levels of functional diversity. When the gamified app design incorporates these attributes, primary education teachers perceive that such resources can be integrated effectively into the teaching–learning processes.

Título: Learning from Other Communities: Organising Collective Action in a Grassroots Food-sharing Initiative
Resumo: This paper illustrates the work of creating, infrastructuring, and organising a food-sharing community from the ground up. Drawing on Participatory Action Research (PAR) and a three-year engagement with FoodSharing Stockholm, the paper shows how the processes of starting up a grassroots initiative are shaped by participants’ direct experience and knowledge of similar initiatives. The analysis draws attention to: (1) how central activities such as recruiting volunteers, choosing digital tools, and establishing partnerships with food donors are conceived and organised, (2) the concrete challenges of sharing surplus food, such as adopting a distribution model, and negotiating fairness, and (3) how governance and decision-making models are adopted and (re)negotiated over time. The paper introduces the term Collective histories of organising to capture the impact that learning from previous experiences can have on communities’ efforts to set up and run; and re-orient design visions towards the consideration and adoption of existing sociotechnical practices, rather than always aiming at novel digital explorations. We outline three emerging dimensions that can characterise “Collective histories of organising” as a concept, (1) configuring capacities, (2) configuring sociotechnical practices, and (3) configuring participation. The paper contributes practical sensitivities to build, sustain, and infrastructure surplus food-sharing initiatives, where these three dimensions are discussed as central concerns designers and other food-sharing communities could learn from.

Título: Learning to Be Sustainable in ICT for Development: A Citizen Engagement Initiative in South Africa
Resumo: The uncertainty and complexity of ICT4D projects call into question the suitability of conventional approaches to project management that are imposed exogenously, particularly in relation to the challenge of supporting sustainability and resilience. Attempts to transfer knowledge or ownership to local stakeholders or other responsible bodies fail, and consequently many worthwhile initiatives become unsustainable. The problem is particularly acute in the case of citizen engagement projects, where diverse stakeholders are involved and perspectives need to merge when identifying and realising the benefits of the initiative. Borrowing from literature on project management, knowledge management and organisational learning, this paper draws on experiences from a citizen engagement initiative for basic service delivery in a local municipality in South Africa, by reflecting on the learning processes that can contribute to ongoing sustainability in such projects in the global South. The findings highlight the value of emergent learning and negotiation rather than rigid processes linked to pre-determined success factors that are typically adopted in project-based ICT4D initiatives.

Título: Mapping Risk Strategy of Social Stability Risk Considering Causal Relationships for Energy Infrastructure Projects
Resumo: Social stability risk posed by energy infrastructure projects can seriously affect urban sustainable development. There is thus a need to better understand how risk strategies are designed. However, there is few considerations on risk strategy design by breaking causal relationships. This research innovatively explores social stability risk variables by content mining, develops causal relationships of the social stability risk variables via Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) method, explores core risk variables and critical causal relationships by social network analysis (SNA) method, designs and validates risk strategies. The findings show that: 1) From the overall risk network perspective, the risk network contain 8 core risk variables. 2) From individual risk network perspective, there are 75 critical causal relationships. The top 3 critical causal relationships contain: projects that destroy the cultural landscape would be regarded as threating national security, which often inspires demonstrations among the local people and the line betweenness is the largest (35.589). Traffic congestion by the project is the main reason to cause local small-scale public petition, and the line betweenness is 35.075. Projects that threaten the ecological environment often bring psychological rejection of the project by the local public, and the line betweenness is 30.837. 3) Two scenarios are evaluated in terms of basic scenario and the experiment group scenario. Compared with the basic scenario, risk strategies considering causal relationships have significant effectiveness. The overall risk network density has reduced by 35.22%. The clustering coefficients has decreased by 16.20%. Intermediate central potential has reduced by 9.49%. This study offers a good reference for project managers to complete the sustainable risk control.

Título: Measurements for Energy Efficient, Adaptable, Mobile Systems - A Research Agenda
Resumo: Software systems are the enabling technology for the development of sustainable systems. However, such devices consume power both from the client side and from the server side. This scenario poses to software engineering a new challenge that concerns the development of software for sustainable systems i.e. systems that explicitly characterize the resources under control, that dynamically evolve to maintain an acceptable consumption of resources making the best possible tradeoff with user needs and that are opportunistic and proactive in taking actions that can optimize future resource consumption based on context and past experiences. This paper outlines a research agenda in this area.

Título: Metamodeling and multicriteria analysis for sustainable and passive residential building refurbishment: A case study of French housing stock
Resumo: For the energy-related issues that the world is facing nowadays, the renovation of the building stock is one of the major challenges. The objective of this study is to present an approach that helps to develop a multi-criteria decision support tool dedicated to the rehabilitation of sustainable and passive energy housing by integrating heating energy needs, economic, social and environmental criteria throughout the life cycle stages of the building. The methodology consists of developing metamodels to predict heating energy needs from polynomial regression, design of experiments method and thermo-aeraulic simulations of building behavior. This metamodel is used to carry out a combinatorial study of real technical solutions. The methodology was applied to a real-life existing building located in La Rochelle city (France) based on an in-situ energy diagnosis. Three multicriteria analysis methods were studied and compared: weighted sum, Min-Max and Pareto concept. Furthermore, technical constraints as well as owner preferences and performance constraints have been studied. Optimal technical solutions have been obtained in order to meet the various criteria studied. In addition, window shading and natural ventilation have been proposed to reduce the thermal discomfort rate in summer. This study was extended to all French regions. Finally, this method can be transformed into a decision support tool which will be useful for architects, engineers and stockholders.

Título: Methodological Transition Towards Sustainability: A Guidance for Heterogeneous Industry
Resumo: No matter the sector, type, or philosophy of companies, there is strong evidence of sustainability awareness and environmental proactivity in industry. However, heterogeneity of firms shows that undertaking environmental actions may be a major challenge, where success is not guaranteed. This is a central issue for the ecological transition of industry and, unfortunately, it is an issue that cannot be tackled by a unique perspective. Still, for a transition occur, at least an initial and an envisaged state should be defined; and a procedure for transition between both must be formalized. In this sense, the literature provides methods to define, yet not to enhance the ecological states of firms, exposing a critical inattentiveness in the process for transformation and, in industrial diversity. To stablish the foundation for dealing with these issues, this paper first synthesizes these methods —which showed a strong alignment to Information science and strategic sustainability, and proposes a matrix for transition, composed of an informational and ecological dimension. Later, this matrix is used to propose and fuel a preliminary methodology delineated by different firms. Both are oriented to guide the ecological transition of all kind of companies.

Título: Model Production Based on Industry 5.0 Pillars for Textile SMEs
Resumo: One of the most significant sectors in the global economy is the textile industry, which has been influenced by events such as globalization, technological development, global warming, and the recent COVID-19. It has caused important changes in the way of producing and marketing. Therefore, this article proposes the construction of a theoretical textile production model that incorporates sustainability practices, resilience and focuses on the human being. These concepts are part of the Industry 5.0 (I5.0) philosophy. Through a systematic review of the literature, 58 articles published between 2012 and 2022 were analyzed. The analysis was done using Atlas. ti software, with the application of three questions (who, what, and where) that were answered. In addition, a new complementary literature review was carried out to deepen the research. According to the literature reviewed, still do not have a culture of applying the elements of I5.0 in production models for SMEs. Therefore, in the research, it was not easy to understand the intrinsic variables of I5.0 that SMEs have applied in the textile area. The results show that there are significant deficiencies in the literature on sustainable, resilient production models with a focus on the human being in the textile sector, thus, a theoretical production model is proposed. This model presents the core dimensions of a theoretical model of textile production called “ProS-5.0”, considering innovative approaches based on the concepts of I5.0. These are presented in a holistic way from the point of view of production models, processes, subprocesses, and activities. Likewise, the benefits and challenges of “ProS-5.0” are established. Practical implications and directions for future research are also mentioned.

Título: Modeling SPI Sustainment in Software-Developing Organizations: A Research Framework
Resumo: While software process improvement is well established as a practice, it still presents challenges for some adopters. Drop-outs from SPI programs are not uncommon. The paper argues that SPI sustainment is a function of the organizational context of the program, not just of the program (or SPI ‘product’) itself. Critical in this context is the organization’s operational capabilities and capacity for change, as well as key external factors that, together, can influence SPI outcomes. SPI sustainment is not an established topic of research. To foster interest and progress is responding to the problem, the paper makes a theoretical contribution by developing and proposing a research model of SPI sustainment, called SUSTAIN, from published research on process improvement. Four testable propositions are developed from the model. Implications of the model and plans for future work are also discussed.

Título: Models@run.time: a guided tour of the state of the art and research challenges
Resumo: More than a decade ago, the research topic models@run.time was coined. Since then, the research area has received increasing attention. Given the prolific results during these years, the current outcomes need to be sorted and classified. Furthermore, many gaps need to be categorized in order to further develop the research topic by experts of the research area but also newcomers. Accordingly, the paper discusses the principles and requirements of models@run.time and the state of the art of the research line. To make the discussion more concrete, a taxonomy is defined and used to compare the main approaches and research outcomes in the area during the last decade and including ancestor research initiatives. We identified and classified 275 papers on models@run.time, which allowed us to identify the underlying research gaps and to elaborate on the corresponding research challenges. Finally, we also facilitate sustainability of the survey over time by offering tool support to add, correct and visualize data. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Título: Moving Towards Society 5.0: A Bibliometric and Visualization Analysis
Resumo: This paper aims to provide a holistic approach for a brief understanding of the current state of literature of Society 5.0 by deciphering its characteristics, subjects, the geographical distribution of publications, keywords and general concepts by using bibliometric data retrieved from the Scopus database. We used descriptive analysis to examine publication characteristics, subjects and geographical distribution of published documents, Harzing’s Publish or Perish to calculate citation metric and VOSviewer version 1.6.16 for data and network visualization. Through the network analyses of author and index keyword co-occurrences, research clusters were revealed from different perspectives. The bibliometric analysis indicates that Society 5.0 is heavily influenced by the advancement of the Industrial Revolution (IR) 4.0. The intellectual structure of the Society 5.0 literature is being dominated by engineering-related fields, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT). Our analysis revealed the existence of a strong link in the temporal co-map between Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Society 5.0. This paper also emphasizes on university’s role as an important stakeholder in Society 5.0 ecosystem.

Título: Multi-criteria Assessment of Sustainability for Energy Systems Under Uncertainty: Grey-Based Approach
Resumo: Energy supply and related systems have gained increasing importance in recent years. Energy supply is not only related to the energy sources but also related to production, distribution, storage, sustainability, etc. As the concept of sustainability, it also includes the other important components of energy systems. Because sustainability is valid for everything and one of the most important topics in today’s world. Therefore, sustainability of energy systems should be considered in a holistic manner. Thus, the sustainability of energy systems can be evaluated more accurately and broadly. In this study, a grey-based multi-criteria approach is proposed to assess the sustainability of energy systems under uncertainty. The proposed approach contains two main methods; the grey analytic hierarchy process and the grey MOORA method. In the first part, grey analytic hierarchy process is used to combine the subjective evaluations of the experts and generate the grey decision matrix. Then, in the second part, grey MOORA method is applied to the grey decision matrix for the assessment of sustainability for energy systems under uncertainty. An example is also given for displaying the applicability of the presented approach.

Título: Newcomers’ Barriers. . . Is That All? An Analysis of Mentors’ and Newcomers’ Barriers in OSS Projects
Resumo: Newcomers’ seamless onboarding is important for open collaboration communities, particularly those that leverage outsiders’ contributions to remain sustainable. Nevertheless, previous work shows that OSS newcomers often face several barriers to contribute, which lead them to lose motivation and even give up on contributing. A well-known way to help newcomers overcome initial contribution barriers is mentoring. This strategy has proven effective in offline and online communities, and to some extent has been employed in OSS projects. Studying mentors’ perspectives on the barriers that newcomers face play a vital role in improving onboarding processes; yet, OSS mentors face their own barriers, which hinder the effectiveness of the strategy. Since little is known about the barriers mentors face, in this paper, we investigate the barriers that affect mentors and their newcomer mentees. We interviewed mentors from OSS projects and qualitatively analyzed their answers. We found 44 barriers: 19 that affect mentors; and 34 that affect newcomers (9 affect both newcomers and mentors). Interestingly, most of the barriers we identified (66%) have a social nature. Additionally, we identified 10 strategies that mentors indicated to potentially alleviate some of the barriers. Since gender-related challenges emerged in our analysis, we conducted nine follow-up structured interviews to further explore this perspective. The contributions of this paper include: identifying the barriers mentors face; bringing the unique perspective of mentors on barriers faced by newcomers; unveiling strategies that can be used by mentors to support newcomers; and investigating gender-specific challenges in OSS mentorship. Mentors, newcomers, online communities, and educators can leverage this knowledge to foster new contributors to OSS projects.

Título: Nondestructive Estimation of Total Free Amino Acid in Green Tea by Near Infrared Spectroscopy and Artificial Neural Networks
Resumo: The total free amino acid of green tea was nondestructive estimated by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy combined with multivariate calibration, compared the performance of back propagation neural networks (BP-NN) and partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis. The original spectra of tea samples in wavelength range of 10000-4000cm− 1 were acquired. Spectral pretreatment methods were applied to reduce the systematic noise, and enhance the contribution of the chemical composition. The model was optimized by cross validation, and its performance was evaluated according to root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) and correlation coefficient (R) in prediction set. Experimental results showed that the performance of BP-NN model was superior to the performances of PLS model, from the point of view of the predictive ability. The optimal results of the BP-NN model with multiplicative scatter correction spectral pretreatment were achieved as follow: RMSEP=0.246 and Rp=0.958 in the prediction set, respectively. It can be concluded that NIR spectroscopy combined with BP-NN has significant potential in quantitative analysis and monitor of free amino acid content in green tea.

Título: Observing Social Connectedness in a Digital Dance Program for Older Adults: An EMCA Approach
Resumo: Sustainable societies require healthy populations that are inclusive of all ages in meaningful social engagement. Given the digital nature of contemporary social life, there is substantial interest in how older adults interact with information communication technology (ICT) and new media. For ageing rural populations, ICT is considered opportune to address increasing social isolation and loneliness by connecting older people in digital society. Understanding how older adults experience and achieve social connectedness through ICT is important to inform the development of programs and services designed for their meaningful engagement in social activities. More data is needed, particularly for people living with cognitive challenges, and in rural areas. But there are methodological challenges for this type of research involving this demographic. People living with dementia, for example, may depend on third party support to participate in programs and to articulate experience using verbal language. This paper introduces an international expansion of a study “Improving social inclusion for Canadians with dementia and their carers through Sharing Dance,” [1] a digitally-delivered dance program. The expansion study will examine the impact of the program for social connectedness in an international context, using similar data collection methods to the Canadian study, while adding an additional layer of analysis using ethnomethodology and conversation analysis (EM/CA). This paper will both share findings from the Canadian study and introduce the conceptualization of the international study that builds on its foundation. A sample EM/CA analysis is provided, illustrating observable behaviour for comparison in different contexts, reducing dependence upon verbal language.

Título: On Enterprise Architecture Patterns: A Tool for Sustainable Transformation
Resumo: Organizations across the world today face similar problems, thus, solutions to these problems could also be re-used across many organizations. Climate change is one such common problem to organizations, where any solution implemented by one could be re-used by many others. These re-usable solutions could be Enterprise Architecture Patterns, but there is a lack of guidance on how to use them in practice. This study proposes an extension to the commonly used TOGAF, to better leverage these reusable solutions. Thus, this enables organizations using this framework to enhance it with Enterprise Architecture Patterns. As part of the proposed methodology, re-usable patterns supporting sustainable characteristics are built. The resulting methodology is validated with an expert panel, gathering positive comments.

Título: Open Data Accessibility Mechanisms for Tourism Development in South Africa
Resumo: Employment is a means of addressing the socio-economic developmental challenges of inequality and poverty. In South Africa, tourism has been identified as an important sector for creating employment and various initiatives are being investigated to support the tourism sector. Open Data has been proposed as a mechanism to promote tourism development but how that can be done has not been theorised. Applying Critical Realism as a research philosophy, this study seeks to identify potential causal mechanisms underlying open data accessibility and use towards sustainable tourism development. An exploratory qualitative case study and semi-structured interviews with 25 tourism information managers from the local government and private sector was used to collect data. Thematic Analysis was conducted in phase one of this study’s qualitative analysis. The 15 themes identified were then subjected to affordance-based causal analysis in phase two of the analysis. Three mechanisms (innovation, efficiency and marketing) linked to touristic open data access and use for digital platforms development were identified. This study contributes to the limited body of open data literature in the South African tourism context. The contribution to theory building lies in the causal mechanisms proposed as underlying open data accessibility and use in tourism.

Título: Plant Species Identification Using Computer Vision Techniques: A Systematic Literature Review
Resumo: Species knowledge is essential for protecting biodiversity. The identification of plants by conventional keys is complex, time consuming, and due to the use of specific botanical terms frustrating for non-experts. This creates a hard to overcome hurdle for novices interested in acquiring species knowledge. Today, there is an increasing interest in automating the process of species identification.The availability and ubiquity of relevant technologies, such as, digital cameras and mobile devices, the remote access to databases, new techniques in image processing and pattern recognition let the idea of automated species identification become reality. This paper is the first systematic literature review with the aim of a thorough analysis and comparison of primary studies on computer vision approaches for plant species identification. We identified 120 peer-reviewed studies, selected through a multi-stage process, published in the last 10 years (2005–2015). After a careful analysis of these studies, we describe the applied methods categorized according to the studied plant organ, and the studied features, i.e., shape, texture, color, margin, and vein structure. Furthermore, we compare methods based on classification accuracy achieved on publicly available datasets. Our results are relevant to researches in ecology as well as computer vision for their ongoing research. The systematic and concise overview will also be helpful for beginners in those research fields, as they can use the comparable analyses of applied methods as a guide in this complex activity.

Título: Practices for addressing environmental sustainability through requirements processes
Resumo: Requirements activities performed in a software project are fundamental to address sustainable software systems and products. Although several techniques and frameworks have been proposed to describe sustainability requirements, there is a lack of process support for incorporating them in requirements centered processes. The objective of this paper is to understand the extent to which proposals to develop sustainability requirements can be mapped with the activities and tasks of the requirements processes that are part of ISO/IEC 12207. The set of reviewed papers, extracted from a previous systematic mapping study, was classified with respect to processes tasks. As a result, reviewed papers showed a trend to address tasks from the stakeholder requirements definition process, such as stakeholder identification, elicitation of requirements, and requirements analysis. However, activities and tasks within both the system requirements analysis process and software requirements analysis process need methodological support. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

Título: Prediction Tool on Fine Particle Pollutants and Air Quality for Environmental Engineering
Resumo: This article focuses on the research, design and implementation of a prediction tool for air quality to estimate pollutant concentrations, contributing to environmental engineering. It addresses prediction of fine particle air pollutants of diameter less than 2.5 µm (particulate matter 2.5), their concentration being substantially influenced by urban traffic. We collect worldwide multicity data from health-related public sources on which mining is performed using classical data mining/machine learning paradigms: association rules, clustering and classification. Challenges include adapting appropriate techniques based on data, and capturing subtle domain-specific aspects. The prediction tool is built using knowledge discovered by mining, leveraging health standards, catering to novice, intermediate and expert users. The prediction output is accurate, efficient, interpretable and useful as evident from our experiments. The tool is helpful for urban decision support. This work is beneficial in developing software systems such as intelligent tutors, mobile device apps and smart city tools. It contributes to smart environment, mobility and living, making a positive impact on smart cities and sustainability. In this work, we claim that classical computational paradigms in their fundamental form can be adapted to solve environmental engineering problems, with easy comprehension, as per the Occam’s razor principle that advocates simplicity. This article constitutes applied research: using computational techniques to solve domain-specific problems. Future work includes exploring models in deep learning such as CNN and Bi-LSTM, and considering different types of pollutants as well as other sources besides multicity traffic data, to conduct further studies. This would address additional challenges with enhancements.

Título: Project portfolio management in small context in software industry: A systematic literature review
Resumo: In recent years, the software industry in Latin America, mostly consisted of small companies, has shown a notable increase in its operations. However, the practices they use do not allow them to achieve sustainable growth over time. In particular, one aspect that stands out is the disorder that presents inside the company when managing multiple projects with a very small human team. This paper seeks to identify experiences of application of models related to portfolio management in small contexts in the software industry. The study is carried out through a systematic literature review in relevant digital repositories. We have found 60 primary studies obtained in the search in the considered databases. Primary studies show that project portfolio management models present difficulties in their adoption in small contexts. In addition, there are few studies that refer to experiences of application of portfolio management models in small context in the software industry and point out that a relevant aspect for non-adoption is the lack of understanding of the models in their original proposal. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

Título: Promoting Awareness on Sustainable Behavior Through an AR-Based Art Gallery
Resumo: This paper presents “Augmented Gallery”, an art gallery in the form of a networked, AR-based, audio-visual system, which was devised to convey the visitors a clear message about the urgency of taking action to address environmental threats such as pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss. The system was designed to both entertain and educate the visitors, empowering them to understand how unsustainable behaviours may affect our lives in the future and emphasize the need to take relevant actions for building a more environmentally sustainable world. Augmented Gallery consists of an AR app running on networked smartphones used by visitors. The app displays, at visual and auditory level, scenes representing various healthy environments as well as, via user interactions, their counterpart affected by the consequences of an unaddressed climate change and unsustainable human behaviour, exposing predictions based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change climate report. A user study was conducted, where the gallery was evaluated during two public events. The results showed that opinions about Augmented Gallery were generally very positive. Furthermore, visitors admitted that attending the gallery increased their awareness on environmental issues and their consequences on the planet.

Título: Requirements engineering for sustainable software systems: a systematic mapping study
Resumo: Various approaches toward the development of sustainable software systems have been proposed by the requirements engineering community over the last decade. We conducted a systematic mapping study, analyzed 55 publications, and identified 29 approaches that have been published since the year 2000. We analyzed how the approaches evolved over time and how the publications and authors are influenced by each other. Furthermore, the approaches are analyzed in terms of their supported requirements engineering activities, along with the evidence provided in the publications. Additionally, we also analyzed which sustainability definitions have been used, if an iterative application of the approaches is discussed, and if the approaches also provide a tool-support for practitioners. We noticed an increase of publications on requirements engineering approaches toward sustainability in the last years, whereas a majority discuss sustainability based on the same multi-dimensional concept. Although different case studies have been already conducted, we noticed a lack of an industrial application. Our main findings concern the need of an evaluation on how the proposed requirements engineering approaches can also be applied in agile software development processes. Additionally, we also promote the development of supporting software tools to support practitioners in adapting the proposed approaches.

Título: Resilience and Sustainability of Freight Transport: A Comprehensive Review
Resumo: Market disruption has made the freight transport (FT) activities more complex. In this context and for competitive reasons, companies must operate in more resilient manner to solve problems related to changes without damaging their economic, environmental and social performance. Therefore, a communicative indicator used to monitor the performance of FT and enhance development by prioritizing improvements is crucial. However, the resilience measures of FT were not widely studied in the literature. In this paper, we propose a systematic review of FT resilience by defining it, identifying its indicators and focusing on its synergies with sustainability and collaboration. This work provides a comprehensive view of resilience and the new directions for future research works.

Título: Resilient Strategies and Sustainability in Agri-Food Supply Chains in the Face of High-Risk Events
Resumo: Agri-food supply chains (AFSCs) are very vulnerable to high risks such as pandemics, causing economic and social impacts mainly on the most vulnerable population. Thus, it is a priority to implement resilient strategies that enable AFSCs to resist, respond and adapt to new market challenges. At the same time, implementing resilient strategies impact on the social, economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability. The objective of this paper is twofold: analyze resilient strategies on AFSCs in the literature and identify how these resilient strategies applied in the face of high risks affect the achievement of sustainability dimensions. The analysis of the articles is carried out in three points: consequences faced by agri-food supply chains due to high risks, strategies applicable in AFSCs, and relationship between resilient strategies and the achievement of sustainability dimensions.

Título: Safety Management and Challenges Associated with Industry 4.0 on Transportation and Logistics: A Systematic Literature Review
Resumo: “Industry 4.0” has become the most significant subject of the emerging fields in manufacturing and industrial practices over the decade. It leverages the new smart technologies, including Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, Autonomous Vehicles, Advanced Robots, etc. for the high involvement of automation. Such highly automated processes may raise different concerns from the traditional industry. They should have impacts on the safety management with adaption to the current development. Here we narrow down to the role of Industry 4.0 in the aspects of transformation and logistics and conducted a systematic literature review of the associated topics. We used various tools, such as CiteSpace and VOSviewer to analyze the metadata as well as several collected articles from the databases for trend, co-citation, and content analyses. We found that there is still an apparent lack of studies to incorporate the safety issues in Industry 4.0. And we suggest that safety management for Industry 4.0 on transportation and logistics should consider system design, data communication (as cybersecurity), and integration of intelligent technologies. Subjects of health and sustainability should be also included as challenges related to safety. Though many challenges are needed to be handled, emerging technologies can play significant roles to improve the safety of the work environment in the era of Industry 4.0.

Título: Scientific Discussion: Open Reviews of “ARTI Reference Architecture – PROSA Revisited”
Resumo: This chapter gathers a number of reviews that offer an open, scientific discussion on the transition from PROSA, the well-known reference architecture for Holonic Manufacturing Systems proposed twenty years ago by the School of Leuven, Belgium, to ARTI – the new reference model for IT-based general-purpose control systems proposed by Paul Valckenaers, that stimulates a higher level of abstraction and genericity in understanding and inferring reality. ARTI models architecture elements of reality as intelligent beings in a dominant position relative to their related decision-making components modelled as intelligent agents. The reviews start with overviews of the creation process, the structural elements - holon classes and the features - aggregation, specialization, abstraction levels, flexibility and scalability. The needs that led to the evolution of PROSA into ARTI are analysed: the difficulties to spread the architecture in the research community and industry, the lack of suitability to act as reference architecture for Cyber-Physical Production Systems and Industrial Internet of Things framework in the Industry 4.0 vision of future manufacturing. The reviews discuss the elements and coverage of ARTI, and the translation of basic and staff PROSA holons into new abstract categories: intelligent beings-agents, types-instances, and resources-activities. It is appreciated that, beyond the problem of terminology of PROSA holons difficult to apply in other domains than manufacturing, the move to ARTI assures in-depth interoperability, access to the world-of-interest through digital twins that interact with smart control systems influencing thus these intelligent beings (e.g., plant, shop floor, healthcare system, environment facility, supply chain, service system) into the desired behaviours. From the software implementing point of view, most of the reviewers agreed on the fact that none of the programming languages except for Erlang provided acceptable levels of viability and sustainability for PROSA application classes. An interesting point of view is formulated about the possibility to use ARTI for Enterprise Integration and Interoperability. The present discussions appreciates the new ARTI reference architecture together with D-MAS pattern as an enhanced model to build flexible, intelligent and robust control systems based on prioritizing situation awareness and real-world interoperability. This scientific discussion about the new ARTI model, initiated, presented and critically analysed for the first time in the SOHOMA scientific community needs to be continued by the research community for enrichment and industry adoption.

Título: Self-adaptive and secure mechanism for IoT based multimedia services: a survey
Resumo: With the advent of internet of things (IoT) and IoT multimedia services in real-time applications, including smart healthcare, smart home, and smart connected transportation, IoT multimedia systems have significantly enhanced the lifestyle. However, the increased number of connected heterogeneous IoT multimedia devices have resulted in several vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. The existing multimedia in IoT multimedia security solutions are insufficient for detecting such complex attacks and require a self-adaptive security mechanism that can monitor the changing environment and detect, mitigate, plan, and prevent future prospective attacks in real time. In this study, we conduct a study of several self-adaptive security approaches for IoT multimedia and analyze them based on critical, security metrics to determine their level of support and the achieved satisfaction for IoT multimedia services. The evaluation results show significant insights, challenges, and concerns in the existing approaches, which can provide vital information for the development of future IoT multimedia security research. We propose a self-adaptive security model for IoT multimedia and discuss a case utilizing a mobile e-health system, where we use an adaptation model (using monitor-analyze-plan-execute over a shared knowledge adaptation loop) to determine the adaptation requirement based on the confidence level of several security factors. The adaptation requirement depicts that adaptation is required for stabilizing the security factors in a continuous context-changing sustainable e-health IoT multimedia environment.

Título: Self-organization and multiagent systems: I. Models of multiagent self-organization
Resumo: Nowadays, there are many problems whose complexity is much higher than the capabilities of modern information technologies. Such problems arise in economics, ecology, managing state-level infrastructures and global computer and telecommunication systems, ensuring the safety of society, and in many other fields. Even though these problems seem to be quite different, they have many common features, which imply common difficulties in their solution. These features are as follows: they are large-scale problems, they are open, have unpredictable dynamics and complex structure, include mobile components, and some others. The management in such systems is a challenging task, which requires a revision of modern views, models, architectures, and development technologies. A response to this challenge is the increasing activity in the field of principles and mechanisms of self-organization and in the software tools for their development. Although the paradigm of self-organizing control systems is not new, it is now at a new step of development, which involves, in particular, its integration with the multiagent system paradigm. The purposes of this paper are to analyze the state-of-the art in the field of multiagent self-organizing systems, to provide a critical review of the available applications, analyze development techniques, and generalize the results obtained in this field. The paper consists of two parts. In the first part, we discuss the modern interpretation of the principles of self-organization is analyzed, and the reasons for which the integration of these principles with the achievements in the field of multiagent systems provides a new impetus to the development of information technologies in the context of most complex modern applications. A systematization and description of the self-organization models and mechanisms implemented in the framework of the multiagent architecture is given, and biological self-organization mechanisms are discussed. Applications of self-organizing multiagent systems in telecommunication, grid resource management, and routing in computer networks with dynamic topology, as well as applications in distributed learning and in detecting intrusions into computer networks are described.

Título: Smart City Governance and Children’s Rights: Perspectives and Findings from Literature on Natural Elements Influencing Children’s Activities Within Public Spaces
Resumo: This paper shows a comprehensive literature review based on a comparative method that investigates a set of 25 papers from different disciplinary fields. The articles are retrieved from the Web of Science and SCOPUS databases and individuated through queries containing the key terms child, play, city, neighbourhood, outdoor space, public space, urban space, mobility. The timeframe considered spans from 2004 to present. The analysis focuses on three related aspects: (i) methodology; (ii) conceptual apparatus describing children’s experience of spaces; (iii) green spaces and natural elements incorporated in public space design considered as determinant of children’s outdoor activities. This paper provides detailed information on the relationship between the availability of natural settings and elements and children’s outdoor practices and activities. Retrieving from previous studies the concept of practicability the authors reflect on significance of natural elements in reinforcing the potential of the built environment to promote children’s independent playful practices. This study is instrumental in structuring an analytic methodology for determining a synthetic index of the practicability of public spaces. The relevance of a methodology for assessing practicability relies on its potential to enable a better understanding of conditions conducive to children’s independent playful practices and to support governance by assisting the implementation of strategies of urban regeneration within the smart city paradigm.

Título: Social Position and Gender Perspectives of eLearning Systems: A Study of Social Sustainability
Resumo: The use of information and communication technologies has an increasing impact on our everyday life. The large impact of software engineering on society also means that sociocultural factors are becoming crucial for software systems. Gender and cultural diversity have a significant effect on software development, the sustainability of the software and on the society where the software is used. Thus, these diversity aspects should be analysed while developing a software system. This chapter presents an empirical study that investigates the social position of learner and instructor, gender and cultural differences in needs and use of system features. Our focus is on eLearning systems used in Australia and Saudi Arabia. The results of the study might also be expanded to other application domains such as eHealth and eGovernment. To explore the differences, we applied a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to data collected from 174 participants. The results demonstrated that social position, gender and cultural diversity have significant impacts on users’ needs and preferences.

Título: Socialization in an Open Source Software Community: A Socio-Technical Analysis
Resumo: Open Source Software (OSS) development is often characterized as a fundamentally new way to develop software. Past analyses and discussions, however, have treated OSS projects and their organization mostly as a static phenomenon. Consequently, we do not know how these communities of software developers are sustained and reproduced over time through the progressive integration of new members. To shed light on this issue I report on my analyses of socialization in a particular OSS community. In particular, I document the relationships OSS newcomers develop over time with both the social and material aspects of a project. To do so, I combine two mutually informing activities: ethnography and the use of software specially designed to visualize and explore the interacting networks of human and material resources incorporated in the email and code databases of OSS. Socialization in this community is analyzed from two perspectives: as an individual learning process and as a political process. From these analyses it appears that successful participants progressively construct identities as software craftsmen, and that this process is punctuated by specific rites of passage. Successful participants also understand the political nature of software development and progressively enroll a network of human and material allies to support their efforts. I conclude by discussing how these results could inform the design of software to support socialization in OSS projects, as well as practical implications for the future of these projects.

Título: Software Sustainability Requirements for Knowledge Management Systems in the Cultural Heritage Domain
Resumo: As technology continues to advance and become more integrated into our society, especially in the era of digital transformations, it is imperative that software engineering practices and products are sustainable. However, in the Cultural Heritage domain, sustainability is often overlooked, even though knowledge management solutions are essential for the long-term capture, preservation, and dissemination of cultural heritage in a digital form. This paper aims to address this gap by identifying the key sustainability requirements to consider when designing and developing sustainability-aware knowledge management software solutions for the Cultural Heritage sector. A survey was conducted among professionals with experience in digitizing and managing cultural heritage materials, including cultural heritage experts and software engineers. Despite some differences in the perceived importance of sustainability requirements between the two groups of professionals, the most important sustainability features were mainly agreed upon. The acknowledged requirements encompass features from both the social and technical dimensions of sustainability, such as Usefulness, Effectiveness, and Trust for the former and Maintainability, Functional Suitability, and Efficiency for the latter. The research results provide valuable insights into how domain experts and software engineers view software sustainability in the studied domain. The findings can aid the decision-making process for prioritizing requirements related to sustainability and can serve as recommendations for developing knowledge management information systems in the Cultural Heritage domain with sustainability in mind.

Título: Sustainability and Agility in Project Management: Contradictory or Complementary?
Resumo: This paper aims to analyze the new perspective within the sustainability in project management considering contemporary project management methodologies, practices, knowledge and skills and future trends in this management discipline. One of the main issues at the begging of the 21st century is how to achieve sustainable development. Sustainability as a concept is present at the society level and at the business level as well, therefore there is an increasing effort among researchers and practitioners to integrate project management and sustainable development. In recent years project management discipline is also facing a growing challenge of how to create value and respond to changing the environment, in order to profit. Facing this challenge requires agility. Agile management is now present not only in software development but in other industries too. Based on the analysis of sustainable project management concept, the main challenges of its application, and the key elements of agile project management, the main conclusions of this paper is that sustainability and agility are complementary concepts that help project managers to deal with environment burden.

Título: Sustainable and Social Energy on Smart Cities: Systematic Review
Resumo: Sustainability and social energy are two concepts associated with smart cities. They aim to combat and contain the alarming environmental and socio-economic repercussions that urbanization has been causing on our planet. Smart sustainable cities drive to improve the life quality of citizens while ensuring that they meet the needs of the current and future generations. Sustainability is essential for urban transformation to achieve more resource-efficient, resilient and smart cities. The main objective of sustainable cities is to guide decisions for interventions in the city. Monitoring systems are examples of measures that aspire to ensure greater sustainability and energy efficiency, such as the application of air quality meters or smart water and light meters. Throughout the analysis of the collected data, it’s possible to develop alert systems and optimization models considering various metrics based on artificial intelligence. Therefore, allowing users to make better decisions to positively affect the course of actions in their cities and make it possible to apply sustainability and social energy measures. Thus, it is possible to reduce and improve the consumption of natural resources. Industry 5.0 is crucial in the evolution of smart cities. The complementarity role that this industry has been demonstrating is related to the technologies being developed, in which artificial intelligence plays an important role. This industry places its technology at the service of human beings, society and the environment.

Título: Sustainable Digitalization: A Systematic Literature Review to Identify How to Make Digitalization More Sustainable
Resumo: With reference to sustainable digitalization, available literature reviews do not properly clarify whether digitalization is sustainable economically, environmentally and ethically - in the long period - and whether it is not. The necessity to develop this research lays its basis on the fact that, until now, sustainability researchers and digital scientists have apparently been studying in two separate tanks with few connections between them. With this paper, the authors aim at addressing this necessity. The work aims to analyze the relationship between digitalization and sustainability, and to present a framework to classify the impacts of material digitalization (production, use and disposal of hardware) and the use of digital per se (use of information systems). Subsequently, the paper will present parameters and factors that allow to identify the impacts of digitalization on sustainability and how digitalization can support sustainable growth. To do that, the authors analyzed the existing literature for deriving common understandings of digitalization-sustainability relations. Despite the large research activity on singular concepts like digitalization, digital transformation, Industry 4.0 applications, etc., not all the relevant dimensions between them have been deeply analyzed in a holistic way. The authors’ ambition is to propose a general framework where some accountability could be assigned to specific plans or strategies, in a life cycle view. From such a standpoint a more integrative and sustainable perspective of digitalization effects can be foreseen.

Título: Sustaining Agility: Organizational Change, Factors and Theoretical Lenses
Resumo: Agile organizations have to deal regularly with change and at the same time adapt to sustain agility. In this paper, we present an initial study to identify factors considered when changes need to be made to sustain agility. We used a novel data collection approach, critical decision method (CDM), and investigated three theoretical lenses, paradox theory, situation awareness and shared mental models, to explore the kind of practical consequences they help to uncover. This paper presents the findings of this initial study together with reflections on the data collection method and the three theoretical lenses. Three key dimensions relevant to sustaining agility emerge from the use of these theoretical lenses: teams vs organization; understanding the environment vs the impact of change internally; and understanding “now” vs looking into the future.

Título: Systematic Literature Review of Nuclear Safety Systems in Small Modular Reactors
Resumo: Safety in nuclear power plants is an important area in the realm of engineering safety [1]. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are an emerging form of nuclear technology with widespread application, notably in austere or remote communities. SMRs are defined as power plants that produce 300 MWe or less [2], designed with modular fabrication technology for ease of onsite construction. Historically, nuclear power plants have maximized large economies of scale and been constructed with ample resources for safety regulation concerns, such as access to reliable water tables. SMRs will be deployed to remote locations without the resources normally afforded to a large power plant, and so the safety systems of these new designs must be innovative and still be able to meet the stringent safety specifications set forth by regulatory bodies [3]. This is a very important aspect of SMR design and is critical for licensing and production. This paper outlines a systematic literature review of scientific papers concerned with nuclear safety systems of SMRs. To further expound upon this topic, literature analyses were completed using keyword searches for, “nuclear safety systems,” and “small modular reactor” and then evaluating trends between articles. The databases used for this research were Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, and Mendeley. The analyses were completed by use of the following literature review software: VOSViewer, Publish or Perish, MAXQDA and Vincinitas. The results are presented in the form of trend analyses, keyword cluster analysis, co-author clusters analysis, co-citation analysis, word clouds and emergence analyses. The results show a strong correlation between the study of this material and the rising interest in green energy, as well as the particular safety systems necessary for the development of SMRs.

Título: Task scheduling algorithms for energy optimization in cloud environment: a comprehensive review
Resumo: Cloud computing is very popular because of its unique features such as scalability, elasticity, on-demand service, and security. A large number of tasks are performed simultaneously in a cloud system, and an effective task scheduler is needed to achieve better efficiency of the cloud system. Task scheduling algorithm should determine a sequence of execution of tasks to meet the requirements of the user in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) factors (e.g., execution time and cost). The key issue in recent task scheduling is energy efficiency since it reduces cost and satisfies the standard parameter in green computing. The most important aim of this paper is a comparative analysis of 67 scheduling methods in the cloud system to minimize energy consumption during task scheduling. This work allows the reader to choose the right scheduling algorithm that optimizes energy properly, given the existing problems and limitations. In addition, we have divided the algorithms into three categories: heuristic-based task scheduling, meta-heuristic-based task scheduling, and other task scheduling algorithms. The advantages and disadvantages of the proposed algorithms are also described, and finally, future research areas and further developments in this field are presented.

Título: Temporal Generalizability of Face-Based Affect Detection in Noisy Classroom Environments
Resumo: The goal of this paper was to explore the possibility of generalizing face-based affect detectors across multiple days, a problem which plagues physiological-based affect detection. Videos of students playing an educational physics game were collected in a noisy computer-enabled classroom environment where students conversed with each other, moved around, and gestured. Trained observers provided real-time annotations of learning-centered affective states (e.g., boredom, confusion) as well as off-task behavior. Detectors were trained using data from one day and tested on data from different students on another day. These cross-day detectors demonstrated above chance classification accuracy with average Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC, .500 is chance level) of .658, which was similar to within-day (training and testing on data collected on the same day) AUC of .667. This work demonstrates the feasibility of generalizing face-based affect detectors across time in an ecologically valid computer-enabled classroom environment.

Título: The anatomy of the data-driven smart sustainable city: instrumentation, datafication, computerization and related applications
Resumo: We are moving into an era where instrumentation, datafication, and computerization are routinely pervading the very fabric of cities, coupled with the interlinking, integration, and coordination of their systems and domains. As a result, vast troves of data are generated and exploited to operate, manage, organize, and regulate urban life, or a deluge of contextual and actionable data is produced, analyzed, and acted upon in real time in relation to various urban processes and practices. This data-driven approach to urbanism is increasingly becoming the mode of production for smart sustainable cities. In other words, a new era is presently unfolding wherein smart sustainable urbanism is increasingly becoming data-driven. However, topical studies tend to deal mostly with data-driven smart urbanism while barely exploring how this approach can improve and advance sustainable urbanism under what is labeled ‘data-driven smart sustainable cities.’ Having a threefold aim, this paper first examines how data-driven smart sustainable cities are being instrumented, datafied, and computerized so as to improve, advance, and maintain their contribution to the goals of sustainable development through more optimized processes and enhanced practices. Second, it highlights and substantiates the great potential of big data technology for enabling such contribution by identifying, synthesizing, distilling, and enumerating the key practical and analytical applications of this advanced technology in relation to multiple urban systems and domains with respect to operations, functions, services, designs, strategies, and policies. Third, it proposes, illustrates, and describes a novel architecture and typology of data-driven smart sustainable cities. The overall aim of this study suits thematic analysis as a research approach. I argue that smart sustainable cities are becoming knowable, controllable, and tractable in new dynamic ways thanks to urban science, responsive to the data generated about their systems and domains by reacting to the analytical outcome of many aspects of urbanity in terms of optimizing and enhancing operational functioning, management, planning, design, development, and governance in line with the goals of sustainable development. The proposed architecture, which can be replicated, tested, and evaluated in empirical research, will add additional depth to studies in the field. This study intervenes in the existing scholarly conversation by bringing new insights to and informing the ongoing debate on smart sustainable urbanism in light of big data science and analytics. This work serves to inform city stakeholders about the pivotal role of data-driven analytic thinking in smart sustainable urbanism practices, as well as draws special attention to the enormous benefits of the emerging paradigm of big data computing as to transforming the future form of such urbanism.

Título: The ethics of AI business practices: a review of 47 AI ethics guidelines
Resumo: Many AI ethics guidelines have recently been published that center the fairness, accountability, sustainability, and transparency of algorithmic decision-making. Relatively few guidelines center the ethics of the business practices and political economies in which AI systems are situated. We present the findings of a semi-systematic literature review and thematic analysis aimed at determining the extent to which the ethics of AI business practices are considered in a large sample of guidelines. Our review reveals that the political and economic implications of AI business practices are greatly underrepresented in AI ethics guidelines. In its current state, AI ethics guidelines focus disproportionately on issues of algorithmic decision-making, while the fairness, accountability, sustainability, and transparency of the business decision-making contexts in which AI systems are situated remain seriously undermined by competitive and speculative norms, ethics washing, corporate secrecy, and other harmful business practices. We discuss these challenges, and we suggest that the ontological and disciplinary scope of future AI ethics guidelines should be expanded to better contend with them.

Título: The Paradigm of the Modern City: SMART and SENSEable Cities for Smart, Inclusive and Sustainable Growth
Resumo: The concept of the “smart city” has recently been introduced as a strategic tool to encompass the modern functioning processes of urban development and, in particular, to highlight the importance of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) for developing competitive and sustainable of a city. The present paper aims to shed light on the often still elusive definition of the concept of the “smart city” and tries to define a new reading of the “smartness” of a city that includes the size of the equity as a parameter to (re)definition of the International and European rankings of smart cities. In detail, the classifications made ​​by Boyd Cohen’s of Top Ten Global Smart Cities and Top Ten Smartest European Cities based on the metric of “Smart Cities Wheel” of Vienna Polytechnic will be reinterpreted according to the values ​​of the Equity City Index, compiled by the UN-Habitat 2012. Finally, comparing the two dimensions (smartness + equity) will be presented different possible models of Smart-Equitable Cities and policies.

Título: The Risk of Generating Technical Debt Interest: A Case Study
Resumo: Technical Debt (TD) interest refers to the extra maintenance costs incurred by the very existence of TD items in a system. The generation of TD interest can make or break a system: too little interest and the effect of TD is negligible; too much interest and the system becomes unsustainable. In this paper, we consider the generation of interest as a risk and present a metric to quantify this risk. Subsequently, we validate this metric in two ways. First, we explore whether the metric can be effectively used to prioritize TD remediation. Second, we investigate if adding new code reduces the risk of interest generation. The results of the study suggest that: (a) the proposed risk management metric is capable of efficiently prioritizing TD items; and (b) that the new code that is introduced in the system is usually less risky for producing interest, compared to legacy code.

Título: The role of culture in the adoption of mobile applications for the self-management of diabetes in low resourced urban communities
Resumo: Diabetes mellitus has been documented as a global health problem with a high mortality rate. In the current digital age, the use of technology to overcome such health problems in pursuance of Sustainable Development Goal 3 is widely recognised. The increased penetration of mobile devices provides one avenue to support the self-management of conditions such as diabetes. As a first step towards this, individuals have to first accept and use the technology. However, the literature indicates low levels of technology use amongst diabetic patients with low socio-economic indicators. We posit that the culture of patients is a contributory factor for the low acceptance and use of technology. This study assessed how culture influences mobile health (m-health) acceptance among diabetic patients from low-resourced urban communities through semi-structured interviews. The theoretical model that was used as a lens for the investigation comprised a juxtaposition of Hofstede's cultural dimensions and the Unified-Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). The analysis of the resultant qualitative data indicates that culture does influence the adoption of m-health applications among the research population. The study determined that cultural dimensions in respect of masculinity-femininity have a negative influence while indulgence has a positive influence on mobile application adoption. The findings also indicated that uncertainty avoidance has both a positive and negative influence on m-health application adoption.

Título: The Role of Peer Review in Supporting the Sustainability of Technology-Enhanced Learning Environments
Resumo: We present a series of three studies on the peer review method. We argue that the implementation of such a method in a technology-enhanced learning environment can enhance the learning experience for the students, and consequently affect the sustainability of the learning environment itself. In the context of the paper, sustainability is viewed through a pedagogy lens, describing the property of a learning environment to maintain an active group of students. Finally, we present how different aspects of the peer review process can affect a learning activity.

Título: The Value of Theory in Teaching ICT4D at a Graduate Level
Resumo: Theory forms an integral part of teaching at a graduate level. The incorporation of appropriate theories holds the potential to significantly enhance students’ understanding and insight into an academic discipline. On the other hand, theories not used in an appropriate manner can act as a barrier to understanding and learning. This study concerns the use of theories as part of teaching a graduate Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICT4D) course. The course made use of a textbook where a wide array of theoretical frameworks was incorporated into the study material. During the course, students had to apply theoretical frameworks during each of their essay-type homework assignments, as well as in their take-home exam assignment. As part of the summative assessment, an exam question was given where students had to reflect on the theories they learnt. This question was added to gauge which theories students found helpful in enabling their understanding of ICT4D issues. The responses of the students constituted the empirical data that was qualitatively analyzed. The Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) emerged as the framework that most students found helpful. This finding was surprising since the SLF is not a simple framework to interpret and apply. The results indicate that students appreciate the value of looking holistically at an ICT4D problem context. This study recommends that effective use of theory as part of teaching ICT4D needs to include an accessible introduction, examples of application, students’ own application and ideally also an opportunity for reflection.

Título: Topics in Software Industry Transformation Research: A Topic Analysis of Major IS Conferences
Resumo: As the information load grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to follow-up new trends in business and management. However, new developments in technologies and markets pose threats and open up opportunities to firms. Especially the software business changes continuously and profoundly. It is therefore necessary for researchers and practitioners to follow up recent developments and to cope with the information overload. We suggest the application of a data mining technique in order to automatically identify topics: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Using a sample of 13,799 publications from ICSOB and major conferences on Information Systems, we identify topics relevant to industry transformation research and review their development on a timescale. As proof of concept, we conduct a short case study using Green IT in order to demonstrate that topic analysis can yield relevant results for literature search beyond the results that can be obtained through a simple keyword search.

Título: Towards a Holistic Approach for Sustainable Partner Selection in the Electrics and Electronics Industry
Resumo: In recent years numerous publications in the field of Supply Chain Management have dealt with partner selection methods. So far, research has failed to offer a holistic approach for the selection of recycling partners that accounts for financial, social and environmental factors. In view of this fact, our ,;that supports recycling partner selection in the electrics and electronics industry. Based on a systematic literature review we identify limitations of existing approaches and design an integrated Fuzzy-AHP-TOPSIS model. In addition, relevant criteria for sustainable partner selection are determined. The approach is illustrated by means of an exemplary case study.

Título: Towards Determination of Key Port Performance Indicators for Implementation of Autonomous Ship
Resumo: Autonomous ships are becoming a reality, after the test of the first autonomous container ship in 2019 named “the Yara Birkeland” without any human intervention. This subject is gaining more and more importance in the global maritime sector. In the near future, seaports as the main link in the logistics chain should accommodate autonomous ships in order to sustain their traffic, maintain their competitiveness and fully ensure their role as a locomotive in the maritime transport chain. For this, a dashboard to assess the performance of a port for the implementation of autonomous ships is required. This article aims to determine the port’s performance indicators, allowing the evaluation of suitability for the implementation of autonomous ships.

Título: Towards improving decision making and estimating the value of decisions in value-based software engineering: the VALUE framework
Resumo: To sustain growth, maintain competitive advantage and to innovate, companies must make a paradigm shift in which both short- and long-term value aspects are employed to guide their decision-making. Such need is clearly pressing in innovative industries, such as ICT, and is also the core of Value-based Software Engineering (VBSE). The goal of this paper is to detail a framework called VALUE—improving decision-making relating to software-intensive products and services development—and to show its application in practice to a large ICT company in Finland. The VALUE framework includes a mixed-methods approach, as follows: to elicit key stakeholders’ tacit knowledge regarding factors used during a decision-making process, either transcripts from interviews with key stakeholders are analysed and validated in focus group meetings or focus-group meeting(s) are directly applied. These value factors are later used as input to a Web-based tool (Value tool) employed to support decision making. This tool was co-created with four industrial partners in this research via a design science approach that includes several case studies and focus-group meetings. Later, data on key stakeholders’ decisions gathered using the Value tool, plus additional input from key stakeholders, are used, in combination with the Expert-based Knowledge Engineering of Bayesian Network (EKEBN) process, coupled with the weighed sum algorithm (WSA) method, to build and validate a company-specific value estimation model. The application of our proposed framework to a real case, as part of an ongoing collaboration with a large software company (company A), is presented herein. Further, we also provide a detailed example, partially using real data on decisions, of a value estimation Bayesian network (BN) model for company A. This paper presents some empirical results from applying the VALUE Framework to a large ICT company; those relate to eliciting key stakeholders’ tacit knowledge, which is later used as input to a pilot study where these stakeholders employ the Value tool to select features for one of their company’s chief products. The data on decisions obtained from this pilot study is later applied to a detailed example on building a value estimation BN model for company A. We detail a framework—VALUE framework—to be used to help companies improve their value-based decisions and to go a step further and also estimate the overall value of each decision.

Título: Usability Evaluation of an Intelligent Mobile Chatbot for Crop Farmers
Resumo: The need for a mobile chatbot for crop farmers has been established by many as one major contributor to the sustainable development goals. Most of these chatbots adopt machine learning (ML) approaches. We previously developed a chabot with the ontology-based representation of domain knowledge along with word shuffling and ML-based Jacquard Similarity algorithm. However, its usability evaluation was not considered. This paper aims at evaluating the effectiveness of the developed mobile chatbot through a usability testing method called the Think-aloud Protocol. Using this approach, participants in testing express their thoughts on the applicationwith ontology-based representation while executing set tasks. The users who had the chatbot already running, query the chatbot with randomly selected thirty (30) questions asked in different ways. The result of the experiment shows that twenty-five (25) questions were answered correctly. The user's intent was also considered. The percentage of accuracy of the chatbot is calculated to be 83.3%. The usability evaluation of the developed chatbot gives an acceptable satisfactory average score of 78.5%, being a clear indication that the chatbot is perceived positively and liked by the users as it is efficient, effective, user-friendly, flexible and easy to use. The chatbot usability evaluation results can guide decision makers on the right policies that will affect farmers positively through quality agricultural services for improved agricultural productivity and food security.

Título: Virtual reality for the assessment and rehabilitation of neglect: where are we now? A 6-year review update
Resumo: Unilateral spatial neglect (USN) is a frequent repercussion of a cerebrovascular accident, typically a stroke. USN patients fail to orient their attention to the contralesional side to detect auditory, visual, and somatosensory stimuli, as well as to collect and purposely use this information. Traditional methods for USN assessment and rehabilitation include paper-and-pencil procedures, which address cognitive functions as isolated from other aspects of patients’ functioning within a real-life context. This might compromise the ecological validity of these procedures and limit their generalizability; moreover, USN evaluation and treatment currently lacks a gold standard. The field of technology has provided several promising tools that have been integrated within the clinical practice; over the years, a “first wave” has promoted computerized methods, which cannot provide an ecological and realistic environment and tasks. Thus, a “second wave” has fostered the implementation of virtual reality (VR) devices that, with different degrees of immersiveness, induce a sense of presence and allow patients to actively interact within the life-like setting. The present paper provides an updated, comprehensive picture of VR devices in the assessment and rehabilitation of USN, building on the review of Pedroli et al. (2015). The present paper analyzes the methodological and technological aspects of the studies selected, considering the issue of usability and ecological validity of virtual environments and tasks. Despite the technological advancement, the studies in this field lack methodological rigor as well as a proper evaluation of VR usability and should improve the ecological validity of VR-based assessment and rehabilitation of USN.

Título: Virtualization Technology to Support Green Computing Among IT Personnel in the Public Sector
Resumo: This paper presents virtualization technology that supports green computing among IT personnel in the public sector. The selection of effective technology in virtualization is crucial to reduce the negative impact of IT usage in the public sector by leveraging resources and maximizing the use of IT devices. Virtualization can provide important processes related to green computing implementation in the organization. However, the organization still faces problems in identifying suitable technology used by IT personnel in the organization. Thus, there is a need to understand the process to select the suitable technology based on the role of people, process, technology, and IT organization structure. The methodology comprises that the work process exploration, end-user segmentation, and technology evaluation process, which is validated by interviewing targeting IT personnel in government-based institutions in Malaysia that have in-house green data centers. The qualitative approach was adopted to understand the work activities of IT personnel and IT devices used to perform the task. A case study approach was used where the data was collected from open-ended interviews, observation, and report documents. The data was analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Then, technology evaluation was conducted to select appropriate virtualization technologies to be used to support green computing in the IT work process by integrating four dimensions that consist of the people, process, technology, and IT organization structure. The results show a list of virtualization technology to support green computing based on the technology evaluation process.

Título: What Drives Success in Data Science Projects: A Taxonomy of Antecedents
Resumo: Organizations have been trying to reshape their business processes and transform them into a smart environment to attain sustainable competitive advantage in their markets. Data science enables organizations to define interconnected and self-controlled business processes by analyzing the massive amount of unstandardized and unstructured high-speed data produced by heterogeneous Internet of Things devices. However, according to the latest research, the success rate of data science projects is lower than other software projects, and the literature review conducted reveals a fundamental need for determining success drivers for data science projects. To address these research gaps, this study investigates the determinants of success and the taxonomy of antecedents of success in data science projects. We reviewed the literature systematically and conducted an expert panel by following a Delphi method to explore the main success drivers of data science projects. The main contributions of the study are twofold: (1) establishing a common base for determinants of success in data science projects (2) guiding organizations to increase the success of their data science projects.

Título: Work-Life Imbalance, Health and Wellbeing of Older Workers: A Meta-analysis
Resumo: This paper aims to provide a meta-analytic examination of the relationship between work-life imbalance and health and wellbeing of older workers. Five hundred forty-four records were extracted from the databases. It was found that the overall odds ratio (OR) between work-life imbalance and the health of older workers was 1.369. Five types of health-related conditions were identified, namely burnout, mental health, physical health, self-rated health and social wellbeing. The category of burnout had the highest effect size and followed by self-rated health, mental health and physical health. The category with the lowest effect size was social wellbeing. The potential moderators in the relationship between work-life imbalance and the health of older workers included gender, region, decade of publication, working class and factors of work-life imbalance. The findings of this study suggest that work-life imbalance has an impact on health and wellbeing of older workers. Policy makers and organizational stakeholders should promote sustainable human resource practices so that staff development and employee wellbeing are targeted at all age groups including older workers. Older workers should have equal access to employability enhancing practices. Older workers and supervisors should be engaged in social dialogue to foster conversations on older workers’ needs and expectations regarding work, non-work and personal fulfillment.
