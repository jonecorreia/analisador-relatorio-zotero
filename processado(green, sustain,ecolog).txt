Título: A Descriptive Categorized Typology of Requisite Skills for Business Intelligence Professionals
Resumo: Business Intelligence (BI) is regarded by executives as a critical practice to adopt and invest in. The purpose of this research is to develop a categorized typology of skills required by BI professionals. A review of extant literature resulted in the identification of twenty three skills. The research aimed to validate these skills, and add additional skills to this typology based on the experiences of BI professionals within industry. These experiences were captured through interviews. Skills were then categorized by identifying commonalities across them. No additional skills were identified by the interviewed participants. A categorized typology of skills was developed which grouped the initial twenty three skills into seven higher order categories. The seven categories of skills were identified as: (1) Prepare data for subject matter expert (SME), analyst or other external party for further analysis; (2) Apply simulation modelling, statistical techniques and provide business insight; (3) Manage stakeholders and project and operational tasks; (4) Develop strategic long term BI roadmap that links to corporate strategy; (5) Understand business processes in order to effectively extract user requirements; (6) Design and code sustainable solutions; (7) Absorb and distribute knowledge.

Título: A Pattern Language for Inter-Team Knowledge Sharing in Agile Software Development
Resumo: Inter-team knowledge sharing is an important aspect of agile software development because it allows agility to be scaled to an entire organization. However, achieving inter-team knowledge sharing is not easy because the practices that allow it to happen are poorly reported In The literature. As a consequence, many Agile Software organizations find It difficult to share Experiences and best practices in their contexts, as well as improve employees' skills and expertise. Results from our previous qualitative Studies enabled us to generate A pattern language that aims to help agile Software organizations to adopt practices for fostering interaction among Agile teams in order to share knowledge Across teams and create collective knowledge. This paper contributes to the Agile Software development and knowledge management fields with practical guidance to organizations aiming those Improvements. "Because of space limitations, we describe only five patterns of the pattern language In This paper, which are briefly presented as follows. Open Workspace helps to stimulate face-to-face conversations across teams. Rotation of Teams' Members is a practice about transferring of professionals to other teams in order to spread technical, methodological and management solutions in a sustainable way. Pair Programming among Different Teams are specially adopted to level technical knowledge throughout the company. Collective Meetings foster inter-team communication and alignment about company's projects and goals. Finally, Technical Presentations Stimulate continuous learning and knowledge sharing behaviour. It is important to note that the adoption of the pattern language is affected by forces, such as organizational culture, environment, and top management and leadership support. These forces need to balanced to facilitate and/or reinforce the patterns.

Título: A Scoping Review of Ethics Across SIGCHI
Resumo: Ethical deliberation has proved a consistent feature of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) since its earliest years, spanning the respectful involvement of research participants to design choices impacting fairness, freedom and welfare. Despite growing discussions, applied knowledge and practical approaches for navigating complex moral dilemmas remain challenging to grasp. Motivated by the need for a structured overview, this paper contributes a scoping review of ethics as discussed across 129 full-length SIGCHI papers containing the search term ‘ethic*’ in their title, abstract or authors’ keywords over the last ten years. Findings show increasing prioritisation of the topic, particularly within Artificial Intelligence. Value-Sensitive and Critical Design appear as the most frequently applied orientations, and participatory approaches are more prevalent than those without end-user input. Engaging with a spectrum from personal to societal concerns, the SIGCHI literature thus echos calls for critical perspectives on user-centred processes and the need to establish more sustainable responsibility structures.

Título: A systematic literature review for software sustainability measures
Resumo: Nowadays, sustainability is a key factor that should be considered in the software quality models. It is increasingly important how environmentally friendly is a software product, both in its execution and during its development process. Therefore, we have proposed, in a previous work, a quality model (25010+S) an extension of the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by considering aspects of sustainability on its characteristics and sub-characteristics. However, in order to make the model useful, it is necessary to identify measures for each sub-characteristic and characteristic. For that reason, the objective of this paper is to carry out a Systematic Literature Review to discover the stateof-the art in software sustainability measures.

Título: An Ecological Perspective towards the Evolution of Quantitative Studies in Software Engineering
Resumo: Context: Two of the most common external threats to validity in quantitative studies in software engineering (SE) are concerned with defining the population by convenience and nonrandom sampling assignment. Although these limitations can be reduced by increasing the number of replications and aggregating their results, the acquired evidence rarely can be generalized to the field.Objective: To investigate the state of practice of meta-analysis in SE and its limitations, intending to propose an alternative perspective to understand the relationships among experimentation, production, threats to validity and evidence. To propose and evaluate means to strengthen quantitative studies in software engineering and making them less risky due to population and sampling issues.Method: To use the underlying idea from the Theory of Food Chains to alternatively understand the impact of external threats to validity in the SE experimental cycle (experimental chains). Next, to accomplish an initial technical literature survey to observe basic features of secondary studies aggregating primary studies results. Third, to organize a set of experimental chain's concepts and make initial discussions regarding the observed secondary studies concerned with this metaphor.Results: By applying the experimental chains concepts it was initially observed that, although important and necessary, most of the current effort in the conduction of quantitative studies in SE does not produce (mainly due to population/sampling constraints) results strong enough to positively impact the engineering of software. It promotes an imbalance between research and practice. However, more investigation is necessary to support this claim.Conclusion: We argue that research energy has been lost in SE studies due to population/sampling constraints. Therefore, we believe more investigation must be undertaken to understand how better organizing, enlarging, setting up and sampling SE quantitative studies' population by using, for instance, alternative technologies such as social networks or other crowdsourcing technologies.

Título: An Exploratory Study of Deep Learning Supply Chain
Resumo: Deep learning becomes the driving force behind many contemporary technologies and has been successfully applied in many fields. Through software dependencies, a multi-layer supply chain (SC) with a deep learning framework as the core and substantial down-stream projects as the periphery has gradually formed and is constantly developing. However, basic knowledge about the structure and characteristics of the SC is lacking, which hinders effective support for its sustainable development. Previous studies on software SC usually focus on the packages in different registries without paying attention to the SCs derived from a single project. We present an empirical study on two deep learning SCs: TensorFlow and PyTorch SCs. By constructing and analyzing their SCs, we aim to understand their structure, application domains, and evolutionary factors. We find that both SCs exhibit a short and sparse hierarchy structure. Overall, the relative growth of new projects increases month by month. Projects have a tendency to attract downstream projects shortly after the release of their packages, later the growth becomes faster and tends to stabilize. We propose three criteria to identify vulnerabilities and identify 51 types of packages and 26 types of projects involved in the two SCs. A comparison reveals their similarities and differences, e.g., TensorFlow SC provides a wealth of packages in experiment result analysis, while PyTorch SC contains more specific framework packages. By fitting the GAM model, we find that the number of dependent packages is significantly negatively associated with the number of downstream projects, but the relationship with the number of authors is nonlinear. Our findings can help further open the "black box" of deep learning SCs and provide insights for their healthy and sustainable development.

Título: An Overview of Reference Architectures for Cloud of Things
Resumo: Cloud of Things (CoT) is a new paradigm that explores the synergy between Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing and has increasingly promoted the development of complex software-intensive systems in diverse and even critical application domains. In parallel, reference architectures have contributed as a means to capture the knowledge of how to develop, standardize, and evolve software-intensive systems and, as a consequence, have promoted quality issues in different domains. However, there is still a lack of investigation on reference architectures for CoT, which could be impacting the lack of standardization in CoT systems. Hence, the main contribution of this paper is to present an overview of reference architectures for CoT and, for this, we conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS) and found eight architectures proposed quite recently in different application domains. As a result, these architectures have advanced mainly in terms of standardization, but they have not still large dissemination and wider adoption by the software industry. Several open issues can be pointed out, including actions to promote the sustainability of these architectures.

Título: Architectural Technical Debt Identification: The Research Landscape
Resumo: Architectural Technical Debt (ATD) regards sub-optimal design decisions that bring short-term benefits to the cost of long-term gradual deterioration of the quality of the architecture of a software system. The identification of ATD strongly influences the technical and economic sustainability of software systems and is attracting growing interest in the scientific community. During the years several approaches for ATD identification have been conceived, each of them addressing ATD from different perspectives and with heterogeneous characteristics.In this paper we apply the systematic mapping study methodology for identifying, classifying, and evaluating the state of the art on ATD identification from the following three perspectives: publication trends, characteristics, and potential for industrial adoption. Specifically, starting from a set of 509 potentially relevant studies, we systematically selected 47 primary studies and analyzed them according to a rigorously-defined classification framework.The analysis of the obtained results supports both researchers and practitioners by providing (i) an assessment of current research trends and gaps in ATD identification, (ii) a solid foundation for understanding existing (and future) research on ATD identification, and (iii) a rigorous evaluation of its potential for industrial adoption.

Título: Assessment Methodology in Smart Cities Based on Public Value
Resumo: Smart city is an approach to managing and coping with urban challenges in search for innovative solutions leading to better quality of life and sustainability in cities. Several initiatives have been undertaken, with a significant worldwide growth trend in the coming years. Such initiatives, however, may require non-trivial public investment, and failures resulting from them can have important consequences such as monetary loss, loss of reputation, reduced confidence and lack of public value. This article aims at setting a methodology in smart cities composed of a reference model and an assessment method from the Public Value perspective. It follows Design Science as its epistemological paradigm and Design Science Research as its method, uniting theoretical and methodological rigor as well as practical utility for society.

Título: BEATS: Search Engine for Architectural Strategies for Security
Resumo: The software system’s architecture is an important artifact for addressing, at design time, quality attributes requirements, e.g., performance, reliability, scalability, and security, i.e., focus of this work. Some design strategies, such the application of architectural patterns or tactics, are available in literature and industry. Their reuse is considered a good practice, since they are proven solutions in real industry scenarios, in a diversity of problems, for instance, software vulnerabilities mitigation. Specifically, architectural strategies for security are widespread through different information sources, mostly closed to community contributions, impeding the consolidation of sustainable body of knowledge for security-by-design strategies. We propose BEATS, a web browser of architectural strategies for security. This tool aims to assist the unification and centralization of architectural knowledge for security reported in diverse information sources. BEATS is a more complete repository, with a friendly user interface. It also allows the security-by-design community contributions, adding new strategies and maintaining all knowledge updated over time. Video Link: https://youtu.be/76oQaX9tNuY

Título: Blinded by Simplicity: Locating the Social Dimension in Software Development Process Literature
Resumo: The software development process is a complex human, intellectual and labor-intensive activity and human related factors have shown to be the most significant contributors to software system failures. Lacking the ability to identify or quantify these factors, software practitioners will not learn from the failures caused by them. Although, social factors give rise to high failure rates in software development projects they tend to be ignored. Business continues as usual. The inability for software engineers to attain a holistic and inclusive approach will leave the social dimension out and undermine the realization of a fully sustainable software development process.This paper builds on the master's thesis with the same title completed in December 2019 at Stockholm University. The thesis demonstrates how research literature on software development processes addresses (or not) the social dimension of sustainability from a holistic point of view. The results indicate that the practice of dealing holistically with complexity including the social dimension is still underdeveloped. Further research is suggested regarding the development of adequate supporting tools, social skills, and managerial attitudes and behaviors.

Título: Blockchain and Sustainability: A Systematic Mapping Study
Resumo: Sustainability is a topic of increasing interest. The United Nations has released a list of 17 goals for sustainable development for the global community. Blockchain is a recent technological innovation that shows great promise in changing industries. In this paper, we look speciﬁcally at smart grids and supply chain management systems as areas where sustainable technological innovation can happen. To identify software engineering aspects of blockchain in smart grids and supply chain management, we start upon online libraries focusing on engineering and information technology, and we opted for the methodology of systematic mapping studies in software engineering. The search strategy identiﬁed 535 papers, of which 60 were identiﬁed as main studies for our mapping. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no previous similar studies exist. Results of the study show that the research connecting blockchain technology to smart grids and supply chain management systems is still young. None of the techniques or systems have yet been implemented in a real life setting. As such, more work has to be done before we can look at the actual implications of putting such technologies into use. Software engineering practices could prove to be very useful in the process of development. We propose that future studies can focus on bringing the technologies closer to real life implementations, as well as how to involve the end users in the development of the blockchain-based systems.

Título: Computer Science Innovation in Thailand
Resumo: This paper reports on an empirical qualitative study of computer science education in Thailand following an aid project. The project was attempting to improve teaching quality at a time of significant change in educational delivery worldwide (1999–2004). The focus of the study was to determine the diffusion and extent of adoption of the presented technological and educational innovations and to evaluate project success from the Thai perspective. Interviews from ten computer science departments were analysed in relation to computer science technologies, teaching methods, innovation diffusion and adoption, organizational culture, systems success and national cultural behaviour. Academic perceptions indicated project success with the adoption of numerous technological innovations, curricula, teaching and research innovations, but that this success did not necessarily equate to widespread sustained innovation. Conclusions from the research identified factors influencing educational reform in computer science in a cultural context. A theoretical model, showing the external and stakeholder influences, was developed showing the factors motivating and inhibiting innovation adoption. Of particular interest was the influence of national behavioural culture, institutional development and change agents' activities including their communication strategies and influence on policymakers and peer networks to improve the sustainability of Thai computer science innovation.

Título: Conceptual Architecture of GATE Big Data Platform
Resumo: Today we experience a data-driven society. All human activities, industrial processes and research lead to data generation of unprecedented scale, spurring new products, services and businesses. Big Data and its application have been a target for European Commission – with more than 100 FP7 and about 50 H2020 funded projects under Big Data domain. GATE project aims to establish and sustain in the long run a Centre of Excellence as collaborative environment for conducting Big Data research and innovation, facilitated by GATE platform and Innovation Labs. This paper proposes a conceptual architecture of GATE platform, that is holistic, symbiotic, open, evolving and data-integrated. It is also modular and with component-based design that allows to position a mix of products and tools from different providers. GATE platform will enable start-ups, SMEs and large enterprises, as well as other organizations in a wide range of sectors, to build advanced Data driven services and applications. The usability of the proposed architecture is proven through a development of a sample time series data visualization application. Its architecture follows the proposed one through implementation of required components using open technology stack.

Título: Corporate Dominance in Open Source Ecosystems: A Case Study of OpenStack
Resumo: Corporate participation plays an increasing role in Open Source Software (OSS) development. Unlike volunteers in OSS projects, companies are driven by business objectives. To pursue corporate interests, companies may try to dominate the development direction of OSS projects. One company's domination in OSS may 'crowd out' other contributors, changing the nature of the project, and jeopardizing the sustainability of the OSS ecosystem. Prior studies of corporate involvement in OSS have primarily focused on predominately positive aspects such as business strategies, contribution models, and collaboration patterns. However, there is a scarcity of research on the potential drawbacks of corporate engagement. In this paper, we investigate corporate dominance in OSS ecosystems. We draw on the field of Economics and quantify company domination using a dominance measure; we investigate the prevalence, patterns, and impact of domination in the evolution of the OpenStack ecosystem. We find evidence of company domination in over 73% of the repositories in OpenStack, and approximately 25% of companies dominate one or more repositories per version. We identify five patterns of corporate dominance: Early incubation, Full-time hosting, Growing domination, Occasional domination, and Last remaining. We find that domination has a significantly negative relationship with the survival probability of OSS projects. This study provides insights for building sustainable relationships between companies and the OSS ecosystems in which they seek to get involved.

Título: Current Challenges and Barriers in Sustainable Web Design: A Qualitative Study
Resumo: Sustainable web design plays a crucial role in mitigating the environmental impact of websites and digital services. However, there is still a long way to go in implementing sustainable web design practices. To understand current challenges and barriers in sustainable web design, we conducted a qualitative study gathering data from 27 participants, including practitioners, prospective practitioners, and academia in Norway. Our analysis revealed that a lack of knowledge and understanding of sustainable web design is the most frequently reported challenge. Participants expressed a need for more information and specific guidelines on how to implement sustainable practices. Other challenges included a lack of prioritization among customers, a lack of motivation, comprehension difficulties, and a lack of syllabi in academia. The majority of participants ranked sustainability as their lowest priority, with accessibility taking the top spot due to current regulations in Norway. However, similar challenges were reported in implementing web accessibility, where participants expressed dissatisfaction with the guidelines.

Título: Data Collection and Evaluation Framework for Local Energy Systems
Resumo: Increasing presence of distributed energy resources (DERs) is evolving electricity distribution system to decentralized and active networks. Utilising the data emerging from such networks is an essential step for developing sustainable future energy systems, as such systems must be closely monitored and managed to avoid blackouts and failures. The datasets within energy systems are very large, must be immutable, are often interrelated, yet owned by competing organisations. How then should these datasets be stored and shared? This is the main focus of my research. To provide a reliable way of collecting, storing, sharing, and analysing energy systems data, I propose to use the newly emerging distributed ledger technology. I will work towards developing a middleware-like platform over distributed ledgers, which would aim to provide a reliable data storage solution for immutable energy datasets, while also maintaining relationships between the datasets and addressing the read and write latency and scalability problems of the present distributed ledgers.

Título: Data Discovery for the SDGs: A Systematic Rule-Based Approach
Resumo: In 2015, the United Nations put forward 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030, where data has been promoted as a focus to innovating sustainable development and as a means to measuring progress towards achieving the SDGs. In this study, we propose a systematic approach towards discovering data types and sources that can be used for SDG research. The proposed method integrates a systematic mapping approach using manual qualitative coding over a corpus of SDG-related research literature followed by an automated process that applies rules to perform data entity extraction computationally. This approach is exemplified by an analysis of literature relating to SDG 7, the results of which are also presented in this paper. The paper concludes with a discussion of the approach and suggests future work to extend the method with more advanced NLP and machine learning techniques.

Título: Death of a Software Ecosystem: A Developer Relations (DevRel) Perspective
Resumo: The Developer Relations (DevRel) is a strategy to attract, engage and mature developers in contributing to a platform. It supports the establishment of a Software Ecosystem (SECO). However, even with investments in the DevRel, some organizations face the death of their ecosystems, for example: Symbian (2012), Firefox OS (2016), Windows Phone (2017). It can also be compared based on Ecology to a disruption of the "food chain" that can turn a dynamic ecosystem in a static or dead ecosystem. For example, Microsoft announced in 2017 that Windows Phone would no longer push any updates and became only focusing on maintenance. We want to contribute in understanding how, why and when a SECO is turning on static (i.e., dying) and the "post mortem" status of a SECO. We initially study the Windows Phone from 46,030 questions in Stack Overflow to understand what happens to a SECO when the core platform is discontinued. From our result analysis we perceived that it can be useful to understanding the "vital signals" of ecosystem collapse, migratory/survival patterns, technical resource recycling and the energy transfer among individuals, populations, communities and SECOs. We also contributes with 14 insights.

Título: Dementia and Social Sustainability: Challenges for Software Engineering
Resumo: Dementia is a serious threat to social sustainability. As life expectancy increases, more people are developing dementia. At the same time, demographic change is reducing the economically active part of the population. Care of people with dementia imposes great emotional and financial strain on sufferers, their families and society at large. In response, significant research resources are being focused on dementia. One research thread is focused on using computer technology to monitor people in at-risk groups to improve rates of early diagnosis. In this paper we provide an overview of dementia monitoring research and identify a set of scientific challenges for the engineering of dementia-monitoring software, with implications for other mental health self-management systems.

Título: Democratizing Making: Scaffolding Participation Using e-Waste to Engage Under-Resourced Communities in Technology Design
Resumo: Maker culture and DIY practices are central to democratizing the design of technology; enabling non-designers (future end-users) to actively participate in the design process. However, little is known about how individuals from under-resourced communities and low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds, can practically leverage maker practices to design technology, creating value for themselves or their communities. To investigate this, we collaborated with an e-waste recycling centre, involving 24 participants (staff and low-SES volunteers) in two participatory maker workshop activities. Participants were provided with a generative e-waste toolkit, through which they repurposed e-waste materials and developed novel technology prototypes that created value from their perspectives and agendas. Our findings unpack three factors that influenced their making: balancing personal and community needs; incorporating convenience and productivity; and re-thinking sustainability and connection; and discuss strategies for scaffolding participation and engagement of under-resourced communities in making using an e-waste generative toolkit to democratize technology design.

Título: Designing Sustainable Food Systems
Resumo: There is significant interest in designing technologies for the food system, from agricultural modeling tools to apps enabling humans to assess nutritional value of various food choices to drones for pest detection. However, a good food system must be a sustainable one. There is an urgent need for deliberation and thoughtfulness in designing for both technologies that support existing food systems and new modalities that work towards more sustainable food systems. This workshop will bring together HCI researchers, designers, and practitioners with an interest in exploring what constitutes a sustainable food system, as well as defining the role of HCI in this domain. Our key objectives for this workshop will be to identify what opportunities for design and collaboration exist and to lay the foundation for an active foodCHI community.

Título: Disengagement in Pair Programming: Does It Matter?
Resumo: Pair Programming (PP) requires close collaboration and mutual engagement. Most existing empirical studies of PP do not focus on developers’ behaviour during PP sessions, and focus instead on the effects of PP such as productivity. However, disengagement, where a developer is not focusing on solving the task or understanding the problem and allows their partner to work by themselves, can hinder collaboration between developers and have a negative effect on their performance. This paper reports on an empirical study that investigates disengagement. Twenty-one industrial pair programming sessions were video and audio recorded and qualitatively analysed to investigate circumstances that lead to disengagement. We identified five reasons for disengagement: interruptions during the collaboration, the way the work is divided, the simplicity of the task involved, social pressure on inexperienced pair programmers, and time pressure. Our findings suggest that disengagement is sometimes acceptable and agreed upon between the developers in order to speed up problem solving. However, we also found episodes of disengagement where developers “drop out” of their PP sessions and are not able to follow their partner’s work nor contribute to the task at hand, thus losing the expected benefits of pairing. Analysis of sessions conducted under similar circumstances but where mutual engagement was sustained identified three behaviours that help to maintain engagement: encouraging the novice to drive, verbalisation and feedback, and asking for clarification.

Título: “Do You Collect Data to Give to the University or Do You Do the Work to Benefit People?”: Indigenous Data Sovereignty in Environmental Contexts
Resumo: This paper analyzes the current practices of Indigenous data sovereignty in environmental research and activism in the United States, as known by the settler government. The CARE principles are a widely adopted set of guidelines for Indigenous data sovereignty with guidelines being collective benefit, authority to control, respect and ethics, yet there exists little detail on current practices of operationalization and implementation of the CARE principles. This research specifically identified opportunities to further clarify how environmental data can be managed in accordance with the CARE principles. Using current literature, we examine how sustainability and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research could better incorporate Indigenous data sovereignty and governance. Through three interviews with Indigenous environmental practitioners, we use inductive and deductive analysis to understand current thoughts and practices. In a forestry analysis case study with the Penobscot Nation, we examine specifically how the CARE principles could be implemented into a research project. The interviews and case study reveal design considerations such as emphasizing roles in responsibility and ethics to be taken into future HCI research involving Indigenous data sovereignty in environmental contexts.

Título: Does Miner Pooling Impact Bitcoin's Ability to Stay Decentralized?
Resumo: The Emerging Blockchain technologies have earned substantial attention in the area of Financial Technology in recent years. Its decentralized environment allows for the mining of Bitcoins by miners either independently or in groups. The community of miners have faith in the integrity of each other to sustain the network, through mining pools remaining at a reasonable level of mining power. Blockchain's decentralized system is one of its main selling points and is a source of great attraction for users. However, when these mining pools start to grow and increase their mining power to dangerous levels it can result in a shift towards a centralized environment. This push goes against foundational principles of Bitcoin, leading to ongoing debate among various stakeholders.

Título: E-Commerce Adoption Strategy for E-Library Development in Indonesia
Resumo: The concept of e-commerce adoption has appeared in libraries for decades, but its adoption is slow and partial. In Indonesia, e-commerce is growing rapidly and has the potential to be adopted in various business processes including e-library. The purpose of this study is to develop e-commerce adoption strategies for e-library development in Indonesia. The Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was chosen as the main research method to meet the objective. One of the SLR phases is synthesis, which was conduted using the SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat ) analysis. Then SWOT matrix was validated by expert librarians. The findings of this study are summarized as recommendations to enhance mobile-based services, to develop e-commerce business centers, as well as to integrate library loan and payment systems. e-Commerce system in e-library is better developed by professional software vendors to overcome limited software engineers in most libraries. Collaboration with banks is also needed for legal payment. Besides, optimization of library resource subscription and open access collection can be achieved by consortium of several libraries. Promotion of e-commerce adoption in e-library is also important to increase its sustainability. Validation by experts from academic, national, and research librarians refines the SLR results to meet libraries' vision and mission.

In this sense, it is important to gain more knowledge of how such methods are actually implemented. Objective. The aim of this study is to systematically examine the literature on the use of the flipped classroom method in SE teaching. Method. To achieve the study objective, we conducted a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) starting with 769 studies. After the filtering process, we extracted data from 26 primaries studies, which meet the study selection criteria. Results. We found papers from 2008 to 2020, most of them published in SE conferences. In fifteen papers, the content is delivered to the students before class, nine of them using a specific system developed to this task. We found that the in-class activities follow three main strategies: (1) project-based learning (38.3%); (2) problem-based learning and self-direct learning (50.0%); and (3) team-based learning (7.7%). Reviewed studies reported challenges in implementing FC in ES course such as overworked and time-constrained professors and difficulty in sustaining student motivation. Also, we found studies reporting improvements in student learning and motivation Conclusion. Based on our findings, we conclude the use of an active method has proved to be useful for in-class practical activities, especially related to the software development field. We also observed that adaptive educational content delivery has not been explored in software engineering studies with flipped classes.

Extending existing foci of health and environmental sustainability, food democracy requires thinking through aspects of social and economic justice, and democratic governance as directions for the study and design of technologies for alternative food movements. To exemplify food democracy, we report on field observations and interviews about the opportunities and challenges for supporting the development of local food networks with communities in deprived neighbourhoods using an online direct food marketing platform. Using a food democracy framing, we identify tensions around environmental, social, and economic goals; challenges of local food businesses operating within the existing economic paradigm; and differing perspectives on ownership and governance in the network. We discuss the need for HCI to design for systems change and propose a design space for HCI in supporting food democracy movements.

Título: Green and Sustainable Software Engineering - a Systematic Mapping Study
Resumo: Understanding how the concepts of sustainability could be incorporated to the Software Engineering (SE) concepts has gained increased attention in the last years, particularly in terms of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Several studies have addressed the impact of sustainability in the SE practice, from a range of perspectives. This study presents a systematic mapping study that aggregates, summarizes and discusses the state-of-theart approaches for sustainable SE practice. We analyzed 75 relevant primary studies addressing methods, processes, tools and metrics proposed to support the software development in a sustainable way. The included primary studies were selected using inclusion and exclusion criteria applied to studies published prior to 2017. They were analyzed based on a set of classification criteria, including contribution types, SDLC phases, evidence types, research types, application domains, publication venues, distribution between academia and industry and research methods. The results indicated a growing interest by the SE research community in the Green and Sustainable software domain. Besides, there is an observed need for more studies on techniques, tools and metrics covering construction, testing and maintenance. The results also point out a clear view of the SE community about the need for a better alignment between research and practice in this domain.

Título: How Does Diversity Manifest Itself in Software Ecosystems?
Resumo: Context: Diversity has been addressed in software ecosystem studies in recent years, aiming at the inclusion and collaboration of different groups within organizations and communities. Its several forms of manifesting have required a better understanding of its effects on the ecosystem. Problem: Since an ecosystem involves the interaction of actors over a common technological platform that supports software solutions or services, the diversity and the relationships between different actors remain a challenge, especially in order to sustain the ecosystem and stimulate its growth. Solution: This study aims to understand how diversity manifests itself in the ecosystem context, based on the existing studies. IS Theory: The research was developed under the aegis of the General Systems Theory, focusing on the relationships between the elements of the system. Method: A systematic mapping study was carried out to identify and characterize how diversity in ecosystems has been discussed, which approaches have been applied and which effects are observed. Results: Based on 13 selected studies, we observed that the most discussed type is demographic diversity and the subtype is gender diversity. It was also noticed that gender diversity increases the productivity of development teams, despite the fact that they are still mostly male. Additionally, an analysis was carried out on how these studies discuss diversity in light of the 15 human, technical and organizational factors of ecosystems. Contribution: The five factors that most affect diversity in ecosystems were identified and actionable approaches were suggested to increase diversity in ecosystems, contributing to the Grand Research Challenge in Information Systems “Information Systems and the Open World Challenges”.

Título: ‘I Don’t Need a Goal’: Attitudes and Practices in Fitness Tracking beyond WEIRD User Groups
Resumo: Fitness trackers have the potential for fostering sustained change and increasing well-being. However, the research community is yet to understand what design features and values need to be embodied in a fitness tracker for long-term engagement. While past work mainly focused on WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, Democratic) fitness trackers usersin North America and Western Europe, this paper investigates another perspective on fitness tracking. We conducted interviews with N = 37 fitness tracker users in the US, Europe and Egypt to identify the similarities and differences in attitudes and practices in fitness tracking. We found that fitness tracking involved a deeper social context in Egyptian communities and our findings suggest that Arabic users focused on physiological measurement, while non-Arab Western users appear to bewere more interested in goal achievement. We contribute design dimensions that can help build more inclusive tracker experiences. Our work highlights how future fitness trackers should support a customisable spectrum of design values to offer engaging experiences to a diverse and global audience.

Título: “I Would Be Afraid to Be a Bad CS Teacher”: Factors Influencing Participation in Pre-Service Secondary CS Teacher Education
Resumo: Objectives. Teachers are essential to making computing education available to students. A key place to sustainably prepare computer science (CS) teachers is in pre-service preparation programs, which are often required for certification in the United States. Prior work has examined many reasons that people choose to become teachers — or choose not to — but little prior work has examined factors that shape the pursuit of CS certifications in pre-service in particular. Participants. We recruited five teacher candidates who chose to pursue CS training in a new pre-service teacher preparation program in the United States and five candidates who expressed interest, but ultimately opted out. Method. We conducted semi-structured, remote interviews and performed a thematic analysis to inductively identify factors that influenced candidates’ decisions. Findings. Candidates displayed many conceptions of justice that motivated them to teach CS, including repairing past wrongs in education, improving representation, and expanding literacy. Candidates reported many content knowledge and identity factors, including negative experiences in CS education, low CS self-efficacy, and a sense of not belonging or being respected in CS communities. Capacity for care as novice teachers was another factor: candidates feared not being able to care for students’ needs while experiencing exhaustion from teaching and training during a pandemic, as well as the risks of added course preparation workload from being certified in multiple subject areas. Finally, candidates also considered opportunity costs like loss of income and job security as factors influencing their decisions. Conclusion. These factors highlight the importance of surfacing and dismantling implicit barriers, like injustice and inequity, and explicit barriers, like funding and overwork, so that future teachers feel confident in teaching CS and feel able to create equitable, inclusive environments for students to learn.

Título: Investigating Asset Governance Mechanisms in a Proprietary Software Ecosystem
Resumo: The reuse of artifacts generated throughout the proprietary software development has been improved to support and promote relationships among vendors, consumers and a central organization that maintains the common technological platform. This scenario has been investigated as Software Ecosystems (SECO). When the ecosystem is centered in a closed platform, it is known as a proprietary SECO. In this case, establishing software asset management policies and guidelines is a critical aspect for maintaining a sustainable SECO. Contributions from actors that are external to the central organization should be allowed without exposing internal knowledge and risking the ecosystem robustness of the ecosystem. In this context, this study investigates asset governance mechanisms in a proprietary SECO by: (1) a survey research with 34 participants to capture insights on some mechanisms, (2) a set of 8 interviews with a group of managers to analyze the most relevant mechanisms; and (3) a correlation analysis from the managers’ opinions.

Título: IT Security and IT Governance Alignment: A Review
Resumo: This paper review and align IT Security (ITS) and IT Governance (ITG) that would address ITS strategic and its operational issues. These issues if not addressed accordingly, would lead to a financial aftermath that would put the business at risk and jeopardize the organization's sustainability in both short and long run. There have been studies that show, the lack of technical controls, lack of solid governance and improper oversight at the enterprise stakeholders' level would result to disastrous events. Thus, ITS and ITG has to go hand in hand in order to fortify the security posture of an enterprise. The goal is to roll out an ITS program that would have the best of ITG and ITS best practices. Rather than reinventing the wheel, the affected managers or organizations can adopt and adapt the existing frameworks available easily. There are a few common frameworks available, however there is lack of essential elements especially on ITS management and technical controls. This paper will look into these common ITS frameworks and lists its shortcomings to further understand the need for a better framework. In addition, frameworks that govern ITG will also be studied looking at its advantages and disadvantages. Thus, elements from ITS frameworks will be identified, analyzed and certain aspects extracted as common themes. The analysis shows, the themes depicted are strong management support, fit for purpose context that suits the organization, essential risk management, clearly defined of roles and responsibilities, the importance of training and awareness and the implementation of a quick win strategy. These five themes will be put into ITG practice blocks with respect to the Structure, Process and Relational Mechanisms that spans across People, Process and Technology domains. Finally, the construct named NORLI is proposed to align both ITG and ITS. In the future, NORLI will be tested for its ease of use, effectiveness and efficiency.

Título: Jumpstart Sustainability in Seminars: Hands-on Experiences in Class
Resumo: Sustainability in its different aspects is hardly addressed in software engineering education, neither as quality objective of system development nor in business process design.Consequently, students tend to be unaware of this concept and are not considering sustainability as an important aspect of systems development. This results in the development of (environmentally or socially) suboptimal solutions—although information and communication technology systems could offer great support in promoting and enabling sustainability in our society. To unlock this potential, we are sensitizing students for the issue by gradually introducing the concept in the curriculum.In this paper, we report on experiences in establishing sustainability in the software engineering curriculum of Bachelor and Master students by means of designated interactive seminars. A guideline on how to establish similar teaching activities concludes the paper.

Título: Leaving My Fingerprints: Motivations and Challenges of Contributing to OSS for Social Good
Resumo: When inspiring software developers to contribute to open source software, the act is often referenced as an opportunity to build tools to support the developer community. However, that is not the only charge that propels contributions— growing interest in open source has also been attributed to software developers deciding to use their technical skills to benefit a common societal good. To understand how developers identify these projects, their motivations for contributing, and challenges they face, we conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with OSS for Social Good (OSS4SG) contributors. From our interview analysis, we identified themes of contribution styles that we wanted to understand at scale by deploying a survey to over 5765 OSS and Open Source Software for Social Good contributors. From our quantitative analysis of 517 responses, we find that the majority of contributors demonstrate a distinction between OSS4SG and OSS. Likewise, contributors described definitions based on what societal issue the project was to mitigate and who the outcomes of the project were going to benefit. In addition, we find that OSS4SG contributors focus less on benefiting themselves by padding their resume with new technology skills and are more interested in leaving their mark on society at statistically significant levels. We also find that OSS4SG contributors evaluate the owners of the project significantly more than OSS contributors. These findings inform implications to help contributors identify high societal impact projects, help project maintainers reduce barriers to entry, and help organizations understand why contributors are drawn to these projects to sustain active participation.

Título: Modeling to Support Communication and Engineering of Service-Oriented Software
Resumo: Our research focus is on social and sustainable Service-Oriented software engineering. From a social point of view, understanding social structures in Service-Oriented software engineering can lead to better software (as phrased in Conway's law). From a sustainable point of view, notational, methodological and techological support for Service-Oriented software engineering should aim at retaining past investments (in e.g. legacies), simplifying development processes and addressing global problems like the increasing need for remote collaboration, and the increasing scarcity of energy resources hence demanding for energy efficient solutions.In the S-Cube project the research group adopted a Model-Driven approach to support the communication about, and engineering of, Service-Oriented software. Models, views and viewpoints have been defined to support three main research problems in Service-Oriented software engineering: How to guide migration of legacy assets to services? How agile service networks can support virtual communities aimed at global software engineering? How to support architects and engineers to think in a Service-Oriented way?This research summary presents the three research topics we tackled, the related research questions and an overview of results addressed and developed in the context of the S-Cube project.

Título: Modernization of Legacy Systems: A Generalised Roadmap
Resumo: A number of key organizations are sustaining the decades old complex legacy systems despite their types of services and operating environment. Cloud computing provides numerous processes, tools and methods to emphasize upon the pay-as-per-use utility models. The utter need to modernize these older systems leads to modernization processes involving the vision to leverage the cloud computing benefits. The proposed modernization framework includes decision support module followed by the elaboration of available modernization approaches. This legacy problem is one of the main challenges for cloud computing to deal with. When re-architecting and reengineering these legacy systems, parallel computing approaches also need to be assessed for resource optimization in cloud environments.

Título: On the Presence of Green and Sustainable Software Engineering in Higher Education Curricula
Resumo: Nowadays, software is pervasive in our everyday lives. Its sustainability and environmental impact have become major factors to be considered in the development of software systems. Millennials–the newer generation of university students–are particularly keen to learn about and contribute to a more sustainable and green society. The need for training on green and sustainable topics in software engineering has been reﬂected in a number of recent studies. The goal of this paper is to get a ﬁrst understanding of what is the current state of teaching sustainability in the software engineering community, what are the motivations behind the current state of teaching, and what can be done to improve it. To this end, we report the ﬁndings from a targeted survey of 33 academics on the presence of green and sustainable software engineering in higher education. The major ﬁndings from the collected data suggest that sustainability is under-represented in the curricula, while the current focus of teaching is on energy efﬁciency delivered through a fact-based approach. The reasons vary from lack of awareness, teaching material and suitable technologies, to the high effort required to teach sustainability. Finally, we provide recommendations for educators willing to teach sustainability in software engineering that can help to suit millennial students needs.

Título: On Value Creation in Developer Relations (DevRel): A Practitioners' Perspective
Resumo: Software Ecosystem (SECO) comprises third-party developers cooperating and competing when contributing to a platform provided by a central organization (keystone). A keystone has invested in a Developer Relations (DevRel) internal team as a global business strategy to attract and engage a critical mass of third-party developers in producing and evolving contributions. For this reason, the DevRel team should promote social relationships among SECO actors and synergy among keystone' goals and developers' expectations. It can help to establish and sustain a competitive value creation network (VCN) within a SECO that must survive to inherit changes. However, it is still a challenge the way DevRel team can act on a SECO to better engage the developers' communities aiming to establish a robust VCN. In this paper, we advance on investigating the perceptions of 31 DevRel practitioners from large, medium and small-size companies based on seven countries about value creation in DevRel. We found 55 elements of value creation distributed in retention, efficiency, innovation, and complementarity. Based on our analysis, we contribute with a set of seven insights (feedback loop, loyalty program, roadmap enhancement, technical training, processes restructuring, innovative products, cost reducing) and a DevRel VCN that involves elements, suppliers and consumers. It fosters a common perspective for DevRel practitioners, keystones and researchers for designing strategies and a research roadmap.

Título: Open Approach of Scaled Agile for Organizations and Communities Dedicated to the Development of Open-Source Projects
Resumo: How organizations develop and provide their services and software projects is undergoing significant changes and the work methodology applied has agility as its key element when it comes to successfully facing this process for the transformation of traditional business models. This scenario is not foreign to companies dedicated to the development of open-source projects, whose products have experienced a boom over the last decade, leading more and more organizations to include them in their portfolios to improve their IT management, accelerate their digital transformation and boost their businesses. These changes are due to the unique qualities and characteristics of free software, which provide organizations with a wide range of helpful solutions for data analysis, distributed communication, or application deployment. It is essential for these types of companies, which are often supported by communities of developers, to have a culture and values aligned with agility, to prevent the numerous problems that may be caused by the lack of agility concerning the sustainability and transparency of their projects, thereby seriously damaging their competitiveness. This work presents the current state of a doctoral research to support a new open approach that provides solutions and proposals to these organizations and Open-Source communities, providing them with values, principles, guidelines, and agile skills with which to respond to the difficulties and complex dynamics that they face in the agile scaling process.

Título: Open Source Software Onboarding as a University Course: An Experience Report
Resumo: Without newcomers, open source software (OSS) projects are hardly sustainable. Yet, newcomers face a steep learning curve during OSS onboarding in which they must overcome a multitude of technical, social, and knowledge barriers. To ease the onboarding process, OSS communities are utilizing mentoring, task recommendation (e.g., "good first issues"), and engagement programs (e.g., Google Summer of Code). However, newcomers must first cultivate their motivation for OSS contribution and learn the necessary preliminaries before they can take advantage of these mechanisms. We believe this gap can be filled by a dedicated, practice-oriented OSS onboarding course. In this paper, we present our experience of teaching an OSS onboarding course at Peking University. The course contains a series of lectures, labs, and invited talks to prepare students with the required skills and motivate them to contribute to OSS. In addition, students are required to complete a semester-long course project in which they plan and make actual contributions to OSS projects. They can either contribute to some recommended OSS projects with dedicated mentors, or contribute to any OSS project they prefer. Finally, 16 out of the 19 enrolled students have successfully contributed to OSS projects, and five have retained. However, the onboarding trajectories, final contributions, and retention outcomes differ vastly between the two groups of students with different course project choices, yielding lessons for software engineering education.

Título: Principles of Feature Modeling
Resumo: Feature models are arguably one of the most intuitive and successful notations for modeling the features of a variant-rich software system. Feature models help developers to keep an overall understanding of the system, and also support scoping, planning, development, variant derivation, configuration, and maintenance activities that sustain the system's long-term success. Unfortunately, feature models are difficult to build and evolve. Features need to be identified, grouped, organized in a hierarchy, and mapped to software assets. Also, dependencies between features need to be declared. While feature models have been the subject of three decades of research, resulting in many feature-modeling notations together with automated analysis and configuration techniques, a generic set of principles for engineering feature models is still missing. It is not even clear whether feature models could be engineered using recurrent principles. Our work shows that such principles in fact exist. We analyzed feature-modeling practices elicited from ten interviews conducted with industrial practitioners and from 31 relevant papers. We synthesized a set of 34 principles covering eight different phases of feature modeling, from planning over model construction, to model maintenance and evolution. Grounded in empirical evidence, these principles provide practical, context-specific advice on how to perform feature modeling, describe what information sources to consider, and highlight common characteristics of feature models. We believe that our principles can support researchers and practitioners enhancing feature-modeling tooling, synthesis, and analyses techniques, as well as scope future research.

Título: Provotyping Accountability: Exploring Smartphone Use in the Home through Design
Resumo: In response to research concerns that smartphone usage negatively impacts intimate relationships, this paper presents a study exploring how design can encourage smartphone accountability in family home settings. We developed and deployed three provotypes with seven families via a Research through Design study intended to encourage reflections on ubiquitous and routinised smartphone usage. The provotypes progressively explore ways of making smartphone use visible by facilitating individualised accountability, competitive accountability, and collective accountability. We present insights into how these provotypes shaped family practices based on a qualitative study with 26 participants. We found that, by emphasising different forms of shared accountability, the provotypes reduced smartphone use, which in turn fostered family intimacy and togetherness, rooted in meanings of caring and sharing. Finally, we discuss our study’s implications for how provotypes can help explore forms of accountability in practices involving sustainable technology use within the home.

Título: PSECO-IM: An Approach for Incident Management to Support Governance in Proprietary Software Ecosystems
Resumo: Organizations that produce software cooperatively and competitively to satisfy customer needs give more attention in relationships among several actors (e.g., providers, developers, and IT managers) to build the value creation network called Software Ecosystem (SECO). As a type of SECO, proprietary SECO concerns data concentrated on a platform with contributions protected by intellectual property. The technological platform that supports the business initiatives is developed using different technologies with dozens of integration points, promoting a network of dependencies and architectural complexities. Some studies show that systems downtime (incidents) causes major image and financial upheavals for organizations. To mitigate the risks of incidents, the IT management team should implement strategies based on governance mechanisms to sustain the platform. Our work aims to develop and evaluate a process-based approach (PSECO-IM) for incident management to support the IT management team in the governance of a technology platform architecture in a proprietary SECO. We also addressed some of the identified challenges of quality in proprietary SECO, such as standardized software processes, knowledge management, and governance strategies. As a final result, we got positive feedback on the relevance of the tool in improving governance strategies related to incident management by the organization’s practitioners. We argue that this work is appropriate for the Software Quality area since it covers studies on three pillars: people, process, and technology, such as tacit knowledge, low-quality software, governance, incident management, and proprietary SECO.

Título: RTPTorrent: An Open-Source Dataset for Evaluating Regression Test Prioritization
Resumo: The software engineering practice of automated testing helps programmers find defects earlier during development. With growing software projects and longer-running test suites, frequency and immediacy of feedback decline, thereby making defects harder to repair. Regression test prioritization (RTP) is concerned with running relevant tests earlier to lower the costs of defect localization and to improve feedback.Finding representative data to evaluate RTP techniques is non-trivial, as most software is published without failing tests. In this work, we systematically survey a wide range of RTP literature regarding whether their dataset uses real or synthetic defects or tests, whether they are publicly available, and whether datasets are reused. We observed that some datasets are reused, however, many projects study only few projects and these rarely resemble real-world development activity.In light of these threats to ecological validity, we describe the construction and characteristics of a new dataset, named RTPTorrent, based on 20 open-source Java programs.Our dataset allows researchers to evaluate prioritization heuristics based on version control meta-data, source code, and test results from fine-grained, automated builds over 9 years of development history. We provide reproducible baselines for initial comparisons and make all data publicly available.We see this as a step towards better reproducibility, ecological validity, and long-term availability of studied software in the field of test prioritization.

Título: Scaling Open Source Communities: An Empirical Study of the Linux Kernel
Resumo: Large-scale open source communities, such as the Linux kernel, have gone through decades of development, substantially growing in scale and complexity. In the traditional workflow, maintainers serve as "gatekeepers" for the subsystems that they maintain. As the number of patches and authors significantly increases, maintainers come under considerable pressure, which may hinder the operation and even the sustainability of the community. A few subsystems have begun to use new workflows to address these issues. However, it is unclear to what extent these new workflows are successful, or how to apply them. Therefore, we conduct an empirical study on the multiple-committer model (MCM) that has provoked extensive discussion in the Linux kernel community. We explore the effect of the model on the i915 subsystem with respect to four dimensions: pressure, latency, complexity, and quality assurance. We find that after this model was adopted, the burden of the i915 maintainers was significantly reduced. Also, the model scales well to allow more committers. After analyzing the online documents and interviewing the maintainers of i915, we propose that overloaded subsystems which have trustworthy candidate committers are suitable for adopting the model. We further suggest that the success of the model is closely related to a series of measures for risk mitigation—sufficient precommit testing, strict review process, and the use of tools to simplify work and reduce errors. We employ a network analysis approach to locate candidate committers for the target subsystems and validate this approach and contextual success factors through email interviews with their maintainers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on how to scale open source communities. We expect that our study will help the rapidly growing Linux kernel and other similar communities to adapt to changes and remain sustainable.

Título: Security Thinking in Online Freelance Software Development
Resumo: Online freelance software development (OFSD) is a significant part of the software industry and is a thriving online economy; a recent survey by Stack Overflow reported that nearly 15% of developers are independent contractors, freelancers, or self-employed. Although security is an important quality requirement for the social sustainability of software, existing studies have shown differences in the way security issues are handled by developers working in OFSD compared to those working in organisational environments. This paper investigates the security culture of OFSD developers, and identifies significant themes in how security is conceived, practiced, and compensated. Based on in-depth interviews with 20 freelance (FL) developers, we report that (a) security thinking is evident in descriptions of their work, (b) security thinking manifests in different ways within OFSD practice, and (c) the dynamics of the freelance development ecosystem influence financial investment in secure development. Our findings help to understand the reasons why insecure software development is evident in freelance development, and they contribute toward developing security interventions that are tailored to the needs of freelance software developers.General Summary- Online freelance software development (OFSD) is a significant part of the software industry and is a thriving online economy.

Título: Software Engineering Aspects of Green and Sustainable Software: A Systematic Mapping Study
Resumo: Green and sustainable software engineering is an emerging research ﬁeld which aims at creating, using, and disposing the energy-eﬃcient software in an environment friendly manner with less negative impacts. The research community strongly believes that the energy eﬃciency and sustainability of the software can be improved by modifying the existing software engineering methods. This systematic mapping study identiﬁes and map such methods for green and sustainable software development. Especially, this study identiﬁes the research types, research goals, software engineering research topics, accepted validation methods and publication fora that are used in the ﬁeld of green and sustainable software engineering. This study was conducted with 7 research questions and analyzed 82 relevant studies. We have used snowballing reading to ﬁnd out the relevant studies that were published from 2010 to May, 2016. One of the important ﬁnding of this study is, there are less number of contributions on software design and construction. In future, suﬃcient research works and tools support must be provided to make this research ﬁeld more matured. The main contribution of this study is to summarize the body of knowledge in the ﬁeld of green and sustainable software engineering and provides a platform to conduct future research.

Título: Sustainability Evaluation of Software Architectures: A Systematic Review
Resumo: Long-living software systems are sustainable if they can be cost-efficiently maintained and evolved over their entire life-cycle. The quality of software architectures determines sustainability to a large extent. Scenario-based software architecture evaluation methods can support sustainability analysis, but they are still reluctantly used in practice. They are also not integrated with architecture-level metrics when evaluating implemented systems, which limits their capabilities. Existing literature reviews for architecture evaluation focus on scenario-based methods, but do not provide a critical reflection of the applicability of such methods for sustainability evaluation. Our goal is to measure the sustainability of a software architecture both during early design using scenarios and during evolution using scenarios and metrics, which is highly relevant in practice. We thus provide a systematic literature review assessing scenario-based methods for sustainability support and categorize more than 40 architecture-level metrics according to several design principles. Our review identifies a need for further empirical research, for the integration of existing methods, and for the more efficient use of formal architectural models.

Título: Sustainability is Stratified: Toward a Better Theory of Sustainable Software Engineering
Resumo: Background: Sustainable software engineering (SSE) means creating software in a way that meets present needs without undermining our collective capacity to meet our future needs. It is typically conceptualized as several intersecting dimensions or “pillars”—environmental, social, economic, technical and individual. However; these pillars are theoretically underdeveloped and require reﬁnement. Objectives: The objective of this paper is to generate a better theory of SSE. Method: First, a scoping review was conducted to understand the state of research on SSE and identify existing models thereof. Next, a meta-synthesis of qualitative research on SSE was conducted to critique and improve the existing models identiﬁed. Results: 961 potentially relevant articles were extracted from ﬁve article databases. These articles were de-duplicated and then screened independently by two screeners, leaving 243 articles to examine. Of these, 109 were non-empirical, the most common empirical method was systematic review, and no randomized controlled experiments were found. Most papers focus on ecological sustainability (158) and the sustainability of software products (148) rather than processes. A meta-synthesis of 36 qualitative studies produced several key propositions, most notably, that sustainability is stratiﬁed (has different meanings at different levels of abstraction) and multisystemic (emerges from interactions among multiple social, technical, and sociotechnical systems). Conclusion: The academic literature on SSE is surprisingly non-empirical. More empirical evaluations of speciﬁc sustainability interventions are needed. The sustainability of software development products and processes should be conceptualized as multisystemic and stratiﬁed, and assessed accordingly.

Título: Sustained Agile Usage: A Systematic Literature Review
Resumo: Context: Agile methodologies (AM) emerged as a popular alternative to formalized methods, and have gained widespread acceptance in both the academic and industrial contexts. While most research has focused on their early stages of adoption and use, there is little evidence that agile methodologies have been effectively used beyond the adoption stage. Objective: The objective of this paper is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the various factors that impact the sustained usage of agile methods. Method: We performed a systematic literature review to identify empirical studies relating to agile usage. We followed the guidelines provided for conducting systematic literature reviews in software engineering [<u>1, 2</u>] using the following distinct stages: 1) protocol development and the search strategy, 2) exclusion process, 3) data extraction, and 4) data synthesis. Results: Our review identified nine critical factors viz., Management Support, Attitude, Motivation, Team Composition, Training, Agile Mindset, Technical Competence and Expertise, Agile Engineering Practices, and Methodology Champion. Conclusions: Our review highlights the significance of nine critical factors that impact sustained usage of AM in organizations. Our findings also indicate that the right balance and combination of various factors with an emphasis on continuous improvement will be crucial for achieving true agile sustainability in organizations.

Título: Systematic mapping study on software engineering for sustainability (SE4S)
Resumo: Background/Context: The objective of achieving higher sustainability in our lifestyles by information and communication technology has lead to a plethora of research activities in related ﬁelds. Consequently, Software Engineering for Sustainability (SE4S) has developed as an active area of research. Objective/Aim: Though SE4S gained much attention over the past few years and has resulted in a number of contributions, there is only one rigorous survey of the ﬁeld. We follow up on this systematic mapping study from 2012 with a more in-depth overview of the status of research, as most work has been conducted in the last 4 years. Method : The applied method is a systematic mapping study through which we investigate which contributions were made, which knowledge areas are most explored, and which research type facets have been used, to distill a common understanding of the state-of-the-art in SE4S. Results: We contribute an overview of current research topics and trends, and their distribution according to the research type facet and the application domains. Furthermore, we aggregate the topics into clusters and list proposed and used methods, frameworks, and tools. Conclusion: The research map shows that impact currently is limited to few knowledge areas and there is need for a future roadmap to ﬁll the gaps.

Título: The Effects and Antecedents of Conflict in Free and Open Source Software Development
Resumo: Conflict is an important group process, and more so in self-organizing teams with fluid boundaries and high possibility for turnover. We empirically investigate different types of conflict in Free and Open Source Software development teams, their antecedents and impact on developers&amp;' sustained participation. Following a survey of 222 FOSS developers, we find conflict to have an overall negative effect on developer retention. Furthermore, different types of conflict have varying impact on outcomes. In particular, only normative conflict levels negatively impact intention to remain in a FOSS project. Both normative and process conflict negatively affect perceptions of team performance, while the co-occurrence of task and process conflict exacerbate negative effects on outcomes. Though we find structural factors like task interdependence and geographical distribution increase overall conflict levels in FOSS teams, participatory decision-making and a transformational leadership style have an ameliorating effect. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

Título: The Hard Life of Open Source Software Project Newcomers
Resumo: While onboarding an open source software (OSS) project, contributors face many different barriers that hinder their contribution, leading in many cases to dropouts. Many projects leverage the contribution of outsiders and the sustainability of the project relies on retaining some of these newcomers. In this paper, we discuss some barriers faced by newcomers to OSS. The barriers were identified using a qualitative analysis on data obtained from newcomers and members of OSS projects. We organize the results in a conceptual model composed of 38 barriers, grouped into seven different categories. These barriers may motivate new studies and the development of appropriate tooling to better support the onboarding of new contributors.

Título: "This is Damn Slick!": Estimating the Impact of Tweets on Open Source Project Popularity and New Contributors
Resumo: Twitter is widely used by software developers. But how effective are tweets at promoting open source projects? How could one use Twitter to increase a project's popularity or attract new contributors? In this paper we report on a mixed-methods empirical study of 44,544 tweets containing links to 2,370 open-source GitHub repositories, looking for evidence of causal effects of these tweets on the projects attracting new GitHub stars and contributors, as well as characterizing the high-impact tweets, the people likely being attracted by them, and how they differ from contributors attracted otherwise. Among others, we find that tweets have a statistically significant and practically sizable effect on obtaining new stars and a small average effect on attracting new contributors. The popularity, content of the tweet, as well as the identity of tweet authors all affect the scale of the attraction effect. In addition, our qualitative analysis suggests that forming an active Twitter community for an open source project plays an important role in attracting new committers via tweets. We also report that developers who are new to GitHub or have a long history of Twitter usage but few tweets posted are most likely to be attracted as contributors to the repositories mentioned by tweets. Our work contributes to the literature on open source sustainability.

Título: Towards a common understanding of sustainable software development
Resumo: The underlying principles of Sustainable Software Engineering are a core set of competencies Software Engineers need for defining, building, and running sustainable software applications. However, despite its importance, recently published studies have shown that Software Engineers have not reached a common and clear understanding of Sustainable Software Development (SSD). Consequently, it might be challenging to understand the value of the principles behind sustainability and how Software Engineers should apply them in practice. Therefore, the first step is to promote a field characterization to mitigate such effects to bridge such a gap. This paper reports on qualitative data analysis to leverage the sustainability principles through the support of the Grounded Theory method. We conducted this study using unstructured data retrieved from a systematic mapping study on sustainable software engineering and a survey applied in the software industry. To achieve the principles, we considered five critical dimensions: economic, social, individual, environmental, and technical. The key results are: (i) technical, environmental, and social concerns are present in all software development life-cycle (SDLC) phases; (ii) software engineers should consider sustainability requirements in the early SDLC phases; (iii) there is a need for stakeholder engagement focused on sustainability; (iv) software quality requirements support the development of sustainable software; and (v) sustainable concerns could generate trade-offs in the project. The yielded results might trigger further discussions around the SSD’s underlying principles and concepts and serve as a basis for the research community to identify models, techniques, and tools to support SSD.

Título: Towards a Critical Open-Source Software Database
Resumo: Open-source software (OSS) plays a vital role in the modern software ecosystem. However, the maintenance and sustainability of OSS projects can be challenging. In this paper, we present the CrOSSD project, which aims to build a database of OSS projects and measure their current project “health” status. In the project, we will use both quantitative and qualitative metrics to evaluate the health of OSS projects. The quantitative metrics will be gathered through automated crawling of meta information such as the number of contributors, commits and lines of code. Qualitative metrics will be gathered for selected “critical” projects through manual analysis and automated tools, including aspects such as sustainability, funding, community engagement and adherence to security policies. The results of the analysis will be presented on a user-friendly web platform, which will allow users to view the health of individual OSS projects as well as the overall health of the OSS ecosystem. With this approach, the CrOSSD project provides a comprehensive and up-to-date view of the health of OSS projects, making it easier for developers, maintainers and other stakeholders to understand the health of OSS projects and make informed decisions about their use and maintenance.

Título: Towards a definition of sustainability in and for software engineering
Resumo: Sustainability is not supported by traditional software engineering methods. This lack of support leads to ineﬃcient eﬀorts to address sustainability or complete omission of this important concept. Deﬁning and developing adequate support requires a commonly accepted deﬁnition of what sustainability means in and for software engineering.

Título: Towards an Appropriable CSCW Tool Ecology: Lessons from the Greatest International Scavenger Hunt the World Has Ever Seen
Resumo: If you could accomplish a complex, collaborative work task with one tool or many tools working together, which would you choose? In this paper, we present a case study of GISHWHES (the "Greatest International Scavenger Hunt the World Has Ever Seen"), an annual event in which teams spend one week completing complex, creative tasks. Building on the literature of IT ecosystems, we show how teams used different collections of tools to meet their communication needs. We interviewed team members, finding that most teams used multiple tools during GISHWHES. By analyzing which tools they chose over others for each function, we gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of these tools, and the complexity surrounding work processes. In light of this complexity, this research highlights the importance of designing appropriable tools that can work with unanticipated workflows and mesh well with other tools in a communicative ecology.

Título: Towards Sustainability of Systematic Literature Reviews
Resumo: Background: The software engineering community has increasingly conducted systematic literature reviews (SLR) as a means to summarize evidence from different studies and bring to light the state of the art of a given research topic. While SLR provide many benefits, they also present several problems with punctual solutions for some of them. However, two main problems still remain: the high time-/effort-consumption nature of SLR and the lack of an effective impact of SLR results in the industry, as initially expected for SLR. Aims: The main goal of this paper is to introduce a new view — which we name Sustainability of SLR — on how to deal with SLR aiming at reducing those problems. Method: We analyzed six reference studies published in the last decade to identify, group, and analyze the SLR problems and their interconnections. Based on such analysis, we proposed the view of Sustainability of SLR that intends to address these problems. Results: The proposed view encompasses three dimensions (social, economic, and technical) that could become SLR more sustainable in the sense that the four major problems and 31 barriers (i.e., possible causes for those problems) that we identified could be mitigated. Conclusions: The view of Sustainability of SLR intends to change the researchers' mindset to mitigate the inherent SLR problems and, as a consequence, achieve sustainable SLR, i.e., those that consume less time/effort to be conducted and updated with useful results for the industry.

Título: Two Perspectives on Reference Architecture Sustainability
Resumo: In the context of software architectures, sustainability has been investigated as an important quality property to assess how well these architectures support changes over time. Several initiatives to achieve sustainable software architectures/systems can be already found. In parallel, reference architectures have served as an effective support to facilitate and standardize the development and evolution of software systems, including in complex, critical application domains. By encompassing valuable knowledge of specific domains, the reference architectures survival is considered of utmost importance, however, the most of such architectures have not been updated since their first version. Furthermore, there is a lack of works investigating how a reference architectures, by itself, can become sustainable and/or can contribute to develop sustainable systems in a domain. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a first view about sustainability on reference architectures. Resulting from our expertise on reference architectures, we bring out the two perspectives on their sustainability: (i) sustainability IN reference architectures; and (ii) sustainability OF reference architectures. In particular, for the perspective OF, we analyzed 20 existing reference architectures to assess their sustainability, and we found most of them were not updated over time. Hence, we also provide an initial set of aspects that could contribute to address sustainability of those architectures.

Título: UX Research in the Software Industry: An Investigation of Long-Term UX Practices
Resumo: Software industry has sought to apply practices that provide a more meaningful User eXperience (UX) and help maintain a sustainable business. UX Research practices allows conducting research and evaluations with users from the application of methods and techniques. Some UX Research practices reveal longitudinal UX research actions (i.e., Long-Term UX) when they track products' use by users over time. The literature is scarce about studies that discuss the UX Research practices adopted by the software industry and their relationship with the different moments of product use (i.e., before, during, or after). Therefore, we surveyed the UX Research practices which are applied in software development in industry following the systematic literature review process. We selected 45 papers and conducted a qualitative analysis by applying coding techniques. As a result, we identify 38 practices which are classified into six categories, i.e. research planning, data collection with users, data analysis, design with research, organization and communication, and training for the research. Our findings show that 15 of 38 practices are related to Long-Term UX. We also identified the attitudes and needs of Long-Term UX experienced by the software industry.

Título: What is a Data Ecosystem?
Resumo: The way that individuals and organizations have produced and consumed data has changed with the advent of new technologies. As a consequence, data has become a tradable and valuable good. There are now Data Ecosystems, in which a number of actors interact with each other to exchange, produce and consume data. Such ecosystems provide an environment for creating, managing and sustaining data sharing initiatives. Despite Data Ecosystems are gaining importance, until now, there is no common agreement on what theories should look like in Data Ecosystems. The evidence is the lack of a well-accepted definition of the term Data Ecosystem. In order to overcome this gap, in this paper, we investigate some theoretical issues that are relevant for Data Ecosystems. Our main focus is on the aspects related to the components of a Data Ecosystem as well as to propose a common definition for a Data Ecosystem term. Therefore, the aim of our work is two-fold. First, we investigate the state of research on the Data Ecosystem field and related kinds of ecosystems, such as Business and Software Ecosystems to enable the development of a common knowledge base. Second, we extract constructs from relevant studies in order to build a common and cohesive definition for Data Ecosystems.

Título: What Makes Research Software Sustainable? An Interview Study with Research Software Engineers
Resumo: Software is now a vital scientiﬁc instrument, providing the tools for data collection and analysis across disciplines from bioinformatics and computational physics, to the humanities. The software used in research is often home-grown and bespoke: it is constructed for a particular project, and rarely maintained beyond this, leading to rapid decay, and frequent ‘reinvention of the wheel’. Understanding how to develop sustainable research software, such that it is suitable for future reuse, is therefore of interest to both researchers and funders, but how to achieve this remains an open question. Here we report the results of an interview study examining how research software engineers – the people actively developing software in an academic research environment – subjectively deﬁne software sustainability. Thematic analysis of the data reveals two interacting dimensions: intrinsic sustainability, which relates to internal qualities of software, such as modularity, encapsulation and testability, and extrinsic sustainability, concerning cultural and organisational factors, including how software is resourced, supported and shared. Research software engineers believe an increased focus on quality and discoverability are key factors in increasing the sustainability of academic research software.
