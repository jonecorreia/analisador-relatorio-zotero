Título: A 2030 and 2050 feasible/sustainable decarbonization perusal for China’s Sichuan Province: A deep carbon neutrality analysis and EnergyPLAN
Resumo: With the imminent acute problems and the harsh reality of climate change, many countries/groups of countries have developed policies to reduce their carbon emission. At the end of 2020, the Chinese government announced a revised policy that will see the country attain carbon neutrality by 2060 and peak emission by 2030. This study aims to determine the techno-economic requirements for net-zero emission attainment in China. The models created are used to explicate the 100% integration of renewable energy into the energy systems in a Province in China considering the years 2030 and 2050. This study is novel as it aggregates the detailed requirements of all the energy sectors and the government policies for the case study. While the approach presented in this paper is applied specifically to Sichuan Province, China, the application of this method is limitless as it is vast and viable for other countries. This study can also serve as a template for many high carbon-emitting countries with sizeable RE potential. The total energy demand in the case study is summarized under three sectors; electricity, industry, and transport. Following the government policies, renewable energy sources such as wind power, solar PV, river hydro, and biomass are considered for 100% decarbonization of the case study. River hydro being the predominant renewable energy source in this region is constructed considering three levels of hydro (dry, normal, and wet) years. The 2017 energy demand and supply data are first used to develop/validate the model on the EnergyPLAN simulation platform, then the 2030 proposed pathway to peak carbon emission by the government is analyzed. Three innovative pathways to net-zero emission attainment by 2050 are proposed in this study considering the additional use of biomass (BIO model), pumped hydro storage (EES model), and the import of clean electricity from neighboring provinces (IMP model). Based on the analyses in this study, the proposed pathway by the government cannot achieve net-zero emission by 2050, however, the three optimized strategies/models presented in this study show a clearer and faster path to decarbonization. Carbon emission will reduce by 13.26 %, 14.77%, and 15.3 % between 2030 and 2050 reference models for the dry, normal, and wet year scenarios respectively. From the three optimization models, the total cost of the import model was the lowest under different scenarios. Therefore, the economic feasibility of this approach proves the superiority of the import model in terms of economic benefits.

Título: A conceptual framework for identifying relevant features when realizing collaborative circular business models
Resumo: Towards a sustainable future, looking beyond the system boundaries of a single manufacturing company is necessary to promote meaningful collaborations in terms of circular economy principles. In this context digital data processing technologies to connect the potential collaborators are seen as enablers to make use of proven collaborative circular business models (CCBMs). Since most of such data processing technologies rely on features to describe the entities involved, it is essential to provide guidance for identifying and selecting the relevant and most appropriate ones. Defining critical success factors (CSFs) is considered a suitable instrument to describe the decisive factors. A systematic literature review (SLR), followed by a qualitative synthesis is investigating two scientific fields of work, namely (1) the general relevant features of CCBMs and, (2) methodologies for determining CSFs. This results in the development of a conceptual framework which provides guidance for digital applications that perform further digital processing based on the relevant CSFs relating to the specific CCBM.

Título: A critical professional ethical analysis of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)
Resumo: Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) have quickly become an important part of the blockchain economy, theoretically representing ownership of a digital asset registered on a public blockchain such as Ethereum. While several applications of this technology exist, the key underlying factor in NFTs’ success is in their potential for investment – buying, selling, and trading the digital assets such as artwork or video game items using cryptocurrency. The rise and mid-2022 crash of NFT and associated crypto markets have shown the volatility of the sector, and questions have been raised around the sustainability, environmental impact, and exploitative practices within this space – and whether there are, in fact, any possible socially responsible use cases for NFTs. This paper aims to fill a gap in the literature surrounding NFTs, primarily through a thorough ethical analysis of the technology and its implementation, deployment, and sustainability. To do this, it uses the Association of Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct as a framework for analysis and, following this analysis, makes some recommendations for those wishing to investigate and/or implement NFTs in an ethically responsible manner. The key message is that unless there is absolutely no other way to solve a problem other than using NFTs, then they should not be implemented, as there is currently no ethical use case or means of implementation of NFTs.

Título: A decision support framework for metrics selection in goal-based measurement programs: GQM-DSFMS
Resumo: Software organizations face challenges in managing and sustaining their measurement programs over time. The complexity of measurement programs increase with exploding number of goals and metrics to collect. At the same time, organizations usually have limited budget and resources for metrics collection. It has been recognized for quite a while that there is the need for prioritizing goals, which then ought to drive the selection of metrics. On the other hand, the dynamic nature of the organizations requires measurement programs to adapt to the changes in the stakeholders, their goals, information needs and priorities. Therefore, it is crucial for organizations to use structured approaches that provide transparency, traceability and guidance in choosing an optimum set of metrics that would address the highest priority information needs considering limited resources. This paper proposes a decision support framework for metrics selection (DSFMS) which is built upon the widely used Goal Question Metric (GQM) approach. The core of the framework includes an iterative goal-based metrics selection process incorporating decision making mechanisms in metrics selection, a pre-defined Attributes/Metrics Repository, and a Traceability Model among GQM elements. We also discuss alternative prioritization and optimization techniques for organizations to tailor the framework according to their needs. The evaluation of the GQM-DSFMS framework was done through a case study in a CMMI Level 3 software company.

Título: A literature review on obsolescence management in COTS-centric cyber physical systems
Resumo: Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)-centric cyber physical systems often contain software and hardware elements with life-spans shorter than the systems’ intended life-span. Various studies have examined hardware obsolescence, although in most systems, software costs contribute as much, or more, to the total life cycle costs than hardware. The aim of our research effort is to explore, synthesize, and compile past research efforts on obsolescence in the context of COTS-based systems, and propose new ways to overcome related issues. This research effort suggests the need for systematic perspectives to streamline potentially overbearing acquisition processes while focusing on core critical aspects affecting systems sustainment and cost. Significant life cycle costs associated with obsolescence mitigation approaches, therefore, programmatic strategic planning should be adapted to include the context of obsolescence with the objective to improve the efficiency of new COTS-intensive CPS systems with enduring perspectives. The study reveals opportunities and challenges for obsolescence in COTS-based CPSs.

Título: A novel big data analytics framework for smart cities
Resumo: The emergence of smart cities aims at mitigating the challenges raised due to the continuous urbanization development and increasing population density in cities. To face these challenges, governments and decision makers undertake smart city projects targeting sustainable economic growth and better quality of life for both inhabitants and visitors. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a key enabling technology for city smartening. However, ICT artifacts and applications yield massive volumes of data known as big data. Extracting insights and hidden correlations from big data is a growing trend in information systems to provide better services to citizens and support the decision making processes. However, to extract valuable insights for developing city level smart information services, the generated datasets from various city domains need to be integrated and analyzed. This process usually referred to as big data analytics or big data value chain. Surveying the literature reveals an increasing interest in harnessing big data analytics applications in general and in the area of smart cities in particular. Yet, comprehensive discussions on the essential characteristics of big data analytics frameworks fitting smart cities requirements are still needed. This paper presents a novel big data analytics framework for smart cities called “Smart City Data Analytics Panel — SCDAP”. The design of SCDAP is based on answering the following research questions: what are the characteristics of big data analytics frameworks applied in smart cities in literature and what are the essential design principles that should guide the design of big data analytics frameworks have to serve smart cities purposes? In answering these questions, we adopted a systematic literature review on big data analytics frameworks in smart cities. The proposed framework introduces new functionalities to big data analytics frameworks represented in data model management and aggregation. The value of the proposed framework is discussed in comparison to traditional knowledge discovery approaches.

Título: A Preliminary Systematic Investigation onto Sprayed Concrete's Environmental Performance
Resumo: Due to concrete's great potential for impact generation, many Life Cycle Assessment studies on that material stand out in specialized literature. Within the scope of a research project entitled “Advanced and Sustainable Sprayed Concrete”, this paper provides results of a systematic literature review performed to investigate sprayed concrete's and its constituents’ life cycle loads. A meta-analysis was conducted to jointly analyze the paper sample and allow for identification of most frequently adopted methodological choices within published LCAs. Systematic reviews consist of an exhaustive summary of high-quality literature on a particular topic, which, in this case, pointed to a clear research gap on sprayed concrete's LCAs. Regarding constituents, results showed uniformity between cement LCAs and great uncertainty associated to chemical admixtures’ life cycle results. This paper's findings are expected to shed light to common practice within building materials’ LCA and to generate much needed knowledge on sprayed concrete's environmental performance.

Título: A Review of Building Information Modelling for Construction in Developing Countries
Resumo: Building Information Modelling (BIM) is widely seen as a catalyst for innovation and productivity in the construction industry. BIM can assist a more sustainable construction process that in turn may contribute to eradicating poverty in developing countries (United Nation Millennium Goals). While BIM is increasingly being adopted in developed countries, implementations in the developing country context are rare. Research has established how construction firms struggle from several limitations having to do with the socio-economic and technological environment found in developing countries. Examples of issues preventing BIM adoption include a shortage of IT-literate personnel as well as an absence of national BIM implementation programs. Based on a review of recent research, this article addresses some of the hurdles and solutions for BIM implementations particular to low- and middle-income economies. Findings include that developing countries’ construction firms rely on outsourcing of IT services or developing tweaks or workarounds, like using ‘fake’ IT licenses, for saving cost and enabling BIM. The article highlights shortcomings of existing research on BIM implementation in developing countries, and may serve as a starting point for researchers interested in how BIM technology can be adopted in a developing country context.

Título: A semantic ontology for representing and quantifying energy flexibility of buildings
Resumo: Energy flexibility of buildings can be an essential resource for a sustainable and reliable power grid with the growing variable renewable energy shares and the trend to electrify and decarbonize buildings. Traditional demand-side management technologies, advanced building controls, and emerging distributed energy resources (including electric vehicle, energy storage, and on-site power generation) enable the transition of the building stock to grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) that operate efficiently to meet service needs and are responsive to grid pricing or carbon signals to achieve energy and carbon neutrality. Although energy flexibility has received growing attention from industry and the research community, there remains a lack of common ground for energy flexibility terminologies, characterization, and quantification methods. This paper presents a semantic ontology—EFOnt (Energy Flexibility Ontology)—that extends existing terminologies, ontologies, and schemas for building energy flexibility applications. EFOnt aims to serve as a standardized tool for knowledge co-development and streamlining energy flexibility related applications. We demonstrate potential use cases of EFOnt via two examples: (1) energy flexibility analytics with measured data from a residential smart thermostat dataset and a commercial building, and (2) modeling and simulation to evaluate energy flexibility of buildings. The compatibility of EFOnt with existing ontologies and the outlook of EFOnt's role in the building energy data tool ecosystem are discussed.

Título: A semi-automated framework for the identification and estimation of Architectural Technical Debt: A comparative case-study on the modularization of a software component
Resumo: Context Research and industry's attention has been focusing on developing systems that enable fast time to market in the short term, but would assure a sustainable delivery of business value and maintenance operations in the long run. A related phenomenon has been identified in Architectural Technical Debt: if the system architecture is sub-optimal for long-term business goals, it might need to be refactored. A key property of the system assuring long-term goals is its modularity, or else the degree to which components are decoupled: such property allows the product to be evolved without costly changes pervading the whole system. However, understanding the business benefits of refactoring to achieve modularity is not trivial, especially for large refactorings involving substantial architectural changes. Objective The aim of this study was to develop a technique to identify Architectural Technical Debt in the form of a non-modularized component and to quantify the convenience of its repayment. Method We have conducted a single, embedded case study in a large company, comparing a component before and after it was refactored to achieve modularity. We have developed a holistic framework for the semi-automated identification and estimation of Architectural Technical Debt in the form of non-modularized components. We then evaluate the technique reporting a comparative study of the difference in maintenance and development costs in two coexisting systems, one including the refactored component and one including the non-refactored one. Results The main contributions are a measurement system for the identification of the Architectural Technical Debt according to the stakeholders’ goals, a mathematical relationship for calculating and quantifying its interest in terms of extra-effort spent in additional development and maintenance, and an overall decision framework to assess the benefit of refactoring. We also report context-specific results that show the estimated benefits of refactoring the specific case of Architectural Technical Debt. Conclusion We found that it is possible to identify this kind of Architectural Technical Debt and to quantify its repayment convenience. Thanks to the developed framework, it was possible to estimate that the Architectural Technical Debt present in the component was causing substantial continuous extra-effort, and that the modularization would be repaid in several months of development and maintenance.

Título: A social and technical sustainability requirements catalogue
Resumo: Climate change calls for action from all sectors of our global economy, including ICT. Therefore, it is important to change the way we develop software to address the challenges posed by sustainability. Our goal is to contribute with a reusable sustainability requirements catalogue that helps developers be aware of sustainability-related properties worth considering during software development. The information for this catalogue was gathered via a systematic mapping study, whose results were synthesised in feature models and then modelled using iStar for a more expressive and configurable representation. A qualitative evaluation of the catalogue's readability, interest, utility, and usefulness by 50 participants from the domain, showed that around 79% of the respondents found the catalogue “Good” or “Very Good”. However, more than 5% of the expert participants found weaknesses regarding most of the evaluated questions and around 25% are neutral in their overall evaluation. This led us to evolve the initial version of the catalogue for the social and technical dimensions of sustainability to improve its completeness and usefulness. This is achieved by aligning the information gathered in the systematic mapping study with the well-established quality model of the ISO/IEC 25010:2011, as we expect most of the experts are familiar with those qualities and respective hierarchies. During this process, we found information that led us to propose two additional qualities that were not covered by the ISO standard: fairness and legislation. We applied this evolved version of the catalogue to the U-Bike project comparing the requirements elicited without the catalogue with those identified using the catalogue. The result suggests that new sustainability requirements were worth considering from a sustainability point of view, supporting the usefulness of the catalogue. © 2022 The Author(s)

Título: A socio-technical systems analysis of the application of RFID-enabled technology to the transport of precious laboratory samples in a large acute teaching hospital
Resumo: The scale and pace of improvement in patient safety in healthcare has been unacceptably slow. A paucity of research into the application of systems-thinking concepts and a failure to appreciate health systems complexity are cited as barriers to sustainable health systems improvement. This study reports on a socio-technical systems analysis, called the CUBE, of the characteristics of a large acute teaching hospital's system for the transport of precious specimens, a system enabled by radio-frequency identification tracking technology. The CUBE proved itself to be an effective analytic tool. The analysis provided a constructive framework to link diverse data and documentation; explicitly inviting consideration of the roles and understandings of different stakeholders; as well as broader cultural factors that could influence current or future activity. The analysis also supported recommendations to improve and extend operations. This study supports the argument for systems understanding and systems thinking being at the core of new approaches to patient safety.

Título: A sustainable-development approach for self-adaptive cyber–physical system’s life cycle: A systematic mapping study
Resumo: Cyber–Physical Systems (CPS) refer to a new generation of systems where the cyber and physical layers are –strongly– interconnected. The development of these systems requires two fundamental parts. First, the design of sustainable architectures –centered on adaptation, throughout a System-Development Life-Cycle (SDLC)– to develop robust and economically profitable products. Second, the use of self-adaptive techniques to adjust CPSs to the evolving circumstances of their operation context. This work presents a systematic mapping study (SMS) that discusses different approaches used to develop self-adaptive CPSs (SA-CPSs) at each stage of the SDLC, focused on sustainability. The results show trends such as (i) Designs are not limited to particular application domains, (ii) Performance was the most commonly used attribute, and (iii) Monitor–Analyze–Plan–Execute over a shared Knowledge (MAPE-K) is the predominant feedback loop applied in the cyber layer. The results also raise challenges such as (i) How to design and evaluate sustainable SA-CPSs, (ii) How to apply unit and integration testing in the development of SA-CPSs, and (iii) How to develop feedback loops on SA-CPSs with the integration of machine-learning techniques.

Título: A system-based view of blockchain governance
Resumo: Context Governance is crucial in achieving the success and sustainability of blockchain systems. However, blockchain governance is multi-faceted, complex, dynamic, and challenging due to its decentralized nature and automatically enforced rules and mechanisms. Objectives This study aims to advance the theory of blockchain governance and support practitioners to deepen the researchers’ and practitioners’ understanding of blockchain governance. Methods The study is a systematic literature review of 75 articles that applies systems theory to conceptualize blockchain governance as a system and parsimoniously organize its interrelated elements into a conceptual model. Results The paper proposes a holistic definition and a conceptual model of blockchain governance. Blockchain governance encompasses technical and social means to make decisions on the different levels (e.g., individual, community, organizational, national, international) related to actors, roles, rights, incentives, responsibilities, rules, and the business, technological, legal, and regulatory aspects of a blockchain system during its whole lifecycle. Conclusion The system-based model of blockchain governance can serve as a reference framework and structured foundation for analyzing, discussing, and developing the governance of blockchain systems.

Título: A systematic for realizing agile principles in the process of mechatronic systems development through individual selection of suitable process models, methods and practices
Resumo: Agile elements support development processes of manufacturing companies by enabling increased customer integration and improved responsiveness to unforeseen changes in the development environment. However, existing agile approaches do not fully meet the additional demands that mechatronics systems development requires of these approaches, for example because of existing organizational structures not considered in the agile approaches. This results in challenges which can lead to considerable deficiencies in the product (e.g. with regard to safety requirements) or the approaches are rejected again. For this reason, this paper analyses a variety of agile and conventional methodologies, process models, frameworks, methods and practices regarding their suitability for the targeted integration of agility into the development processes of manufacturing companies considering different criteria and requirements. A broad literature research was carried out and the development modules (methodologies, process models, frameworks, methods and practices) identified were examined with regard to their suitability for support at both strategic and operational level. The modules were evaluated, among other things, at the strategic level with regard to their suitability for the realization of existing basic principles of agile development of mechatronic systems and at the operational level with regard to the optimization of existing agility-influencing factors. Based on this, a systematic was developed, which supports developers in the selection of agile and conventional development modules according to the objectives, relevant fields of action and specific factors influencing the agile capabilities of organizational units. The developed systematic enables a situation- and demand-based implementation of agility plus increased probability of a sustainable introduction of agility.

Título: A systematic literature review on software measurement programs
Resumo: Context Software measurement programs (MPs) are an important means for understanding, evaluating, managing, and improving software processes, products and resources. However, implementing successful MPs still remains a challenge. Objectives To make a comprehensive review of the studies on MPs for bringing into light the existing measurement planning models and tools used for implementing MPs,the accumulated knowledge on the success/failure factors of MPs and mitigation strategies to address their challenges. Methods A Systematic Literature Review (SLR) was conducted. In total, 65primary studies were reviewed and analyzed. Results We identified 35 measurement planning models and 11 associated tools, most of which either proposed extensions or improvements for goal based approaches. The identified success factors include (a) organizational adoption of MP, (b) integration of MP with SDLC, (c) synchronization of MP with SPI and (d) design of MP. The mostly mentioned mitigation strategies for addressing challenges are effective change management and measurement stakeholder management, automated tool support and incorporation of engineering mechanisms for designing sustainable, effective, scalable and extendible MPs, and measurement expertise and standards development. Conclusion Most of the success factors and mitigation strategies have interdependencies. Therefore, for successful MP implementation, software organizations should consider these factors in combination and make a feasibility study at the very beginning. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Título: A systematic review and analysis of the viability of 3D-printed construction in remote environments
Resumo: 3D-printed construction is an additive, layer-by-layer construction method with the potential to reduce material consumption, optimize design, decrease construction time, lower labor requirements, minimize logistical demand, improve sustainability, and reduce costs as compared to conventional construction. This paper presents the results of a systematic review of 4491 publications spanning from 1998 through 2019. The review presents the viability of 3D-printed construction as a replacement for conventional construction methods, specifically in remote, isolated, or expeditionary environments, where conventional construction capability may be limited. The paper includes an analysis and characterization of the existing body of 3D-printed construction literature before evaluating seven viability factors of the method: materials, structural design, process efficiency, logistics, labor, environmental impact, and cost. In addition, the paper highlights three case studies of 3D-printed construction in remote, isolated, and expeditionary environments. The paper concludes by suggesting areas of future research to ensure the viability of this technology, such as printing full-scale structures and components with locally sourced materials in uncontrolled environments, defining standards for 3D printing, automating additional construction processes, and performing both environmental impact and cost life-cycle analyses. With continued investment in research and development, 3D printing could become a more viable and accepted method of construction, transforming the way the industry is managed in remote, isolated, and expeditionary environments.

Título: A systematic review on techniques and approaches to estimate mobile software energy consumption
Resumo: Developing green and sustainable software has become a prominent topic in research over the last years. While approaches are being constantly researched and developed to estimate and in turn optimize the energy consumption of software applications, there is still a lack of knowledge amongst practitioners how to address energy consumption as an important non-functional quality aspect and in turn develop sustainable software. By providing a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art in mobile software energy consumption, we want to examine how research has contributed to fill this gap in knowledge over the last decade, by providing the foundations to estimate mobile software energy consumption. Therefore, we categorize available work amongst the approach taken to profile energy consumption, the individual contributions and the intended platform of use. Furthermore, we examine the availability of tools and frameworks for research and practice. The foundation for this review is a systematically collected selection of 134 studies published in between 2011 till 2021. From the data synthesised from the selected studies, we discuss key observations and future ongoing challenges in mobile software, energy consumption profiling. Furthermore, we believe that the key for a broad adoption is a common terminology. Henceforth, we propose an ontology describing mobile software energy consumption profiling from the results obtained in the presented review.

Título: A systematic review to merge discourses: Interoperability, integration and cyber-physical systems
Resumo: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are developed through the cooperation of several engineering disciplines. Powerful software tools are utilized by each individual discipline, but it remains challenging to connect these into tool chains for increased efficiency. To support this endeavour, the literature on interoperability assessment was surveyed to identify concepts valuable to transfer from the interoperability to the tool integration research field. Implementation options, types of interoperability and domains described in interoperability assessment models were concepts identified as directly transferable. To avoid the problems with uptake that plague the models identified, visual analytics is suggested as a vehicle for the transfer. Furthermore, based on the use of non-functional properties as an underlying motivation for these models, cost, performance and sustainability are suggested as a common base for future research in both discourses.

Título: A target-driven framework for assessing the effectiveness of product-service-system development approaches at System of Systems level
Resumo: Rapid pace of technological growth led to having more complex product/service-systems (PSS) specially when operating in a large-scale and dynamic environment. A PSS dynamically interacts with society and technological enablers, which together form a socio-technical System of Systems (SoS). However, effectiveness of technologies and development approaches is mostly analyzed without considering the possible rebound effect at SoS level happening due to interactions between systems. This paper aims to propose a vision and a structured approach to assess the environmental impacts due to application of new technology/policy at SoS level by orchestrating various methods to model/simulate the complex structure of a PSS for optimization of its lifecycle parameters. This can support decision- making and mitigate the risk that the movements toward supporting sustainable development have opposite outcomes by putting extra environmental burden on other systems.

Título: A theory of power in emerging software ecosystems formed by small-to-medium enterprises
Resumo: In a software ecosystem, partner companies rely on each other to succeed and survive. This scenario of mutual dependence entails a flow of power among companies. Power is an intrinsic property of their relationship and an asset to be exercised with a degree of intentionality. This paper presents a substantive theory to explain how power and dependence manifest in partnerships among small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) building a software ecosystem. We performed exploratory case studies of two emerging software ecosystems formed by SMEs. We interpreted the results in light of a theoretical framework underpinned by French and Raven's power taxonomy. Finally, we performed a cross-case analysis to evaluate our findings and build the theory. The proposed theory highlights the interactions among different forms of power and corresponding sources of power employed by companies. It provides a better understanding on how power and dependence influence the behaviour and coordination of companies within a software ecosystem. The theory is a useful lens for researchers to explore ecosystem partnerships by understanding the structure and impact of power relationships between partners. In addition, it is a valuable tool for companies to analyse power distribution and define sustainable strategies for software ecosystem governance.

Título: Adding Sustainability to Lean Product Development
Resumo: Where there are calls for sustainable products, the inclusion of sustainability in formal approaches for new product development is still in its infancy. Firms face challenges in (i) managing development of new sustainable products that offer value to customers, (ii) reducing time-to-market and (iii) efficient use of resources. Contrastingly, the rationalisation found in lean product development that addresses these concerns, but not yet sustainability, has attracted the attention of many since its inception in the 1990s. The increasing adoption of lean product development by firms offers the opportunity to also include sustainability in its processes, methods and tools; this will allow new products to be economically profitable, ecologically correct, operationally safe, socially fair and culturally accepted. To this purpose, this paper performs a systematic literature review to find existing methods and tools of lean product development that contribute to sustainability. The findings lead to inference that there is not a lack of methods and tools, but their use. Furthermore, from an integral perspective of sustainability, just a few tools cover the social dimension or the three dimensions all together. Consequently, a holistic systems approach that bring integration and synergy to the use of methods and tools on sustainable product development to the table is needed.

Título: Agile product development: an analysis of acceptance and added value in practice
Resumo: Manufacturing companies are increasingly integrating agile approaches into their development processes. This is expected to improve customer integration, enhance responsiveness to changes in the development context and ultimately lead to improved process and product quality. However, since agile approaches mostly originate from the culture of software development and have been formulated on the basis of observations of successful software projects, new challenges arise in the application of these approaches in physical systems development. Often the approaches fail due to false expectations or lack of acceptance, which causes agility not to be deeply integrated into the processes. For this reason, this contribution presents an understanding of the current state of acceptance of agile working and the expected and perceived added value of using agile approaches in practice. Based on this understanding, future research will develop a systematic by means of which agile elements can be introduced into development processes in a way that is appropriate to the situation and needs, thereby increasing acceptance and perceived added value. Since it is empirical research, which analyses real-world processes, a survey was chosen as a suitable research method. 235 participants from different branches in the area of physical product development in Germany participated. The results were analyzed using usual statistical methods. An assumption that there are discrepancies between strategic and operational views on agile working could not be confirmed. However, optimization criteria in the area of acceptance of agile approaches were identified. The research contributed to the understanding of the current performance level in the field of agile development of physical systems. The identified potentials in the area of acceptance and perceived added value in agile work can now be measured specifically for each individual application and realized with suitable methods, what contributes to a sustainable integration of agile methods into the development processes.

Título: An exploratory study of waste in software development organizations using agile or lean approaches: A multiple case study at 14 organizations
Resumo: Context The principal focus of lean is the identification and elimination of waste from the process with respect to maximizing customer value. Similarly, the purpose of agile is to maximize customer value and minimize unnecessary work and time delays. In both cases the concept of waste is important. Through an empirical study, we explore how waste is approached in agile software development organizations. Objective This paper explores the concept of waste in agile/lean software development organizations and how it is defined, used, prioritized, reduced, or eliminated in practice Method The data were collected using semi-structured open-interviews. 23 practitioners from 14 embedded software development organizations were interviewed representing two core roles in each organization. Results Various wastes, categorized in 10 different categories, were identified by the respondents. From the mentioned wastes, not all were necessarily waste per se but could be symptoms caused by wastes. From the seven wastes of lean, Task-switching was ranked as the most important, and Extra-features, as the least important wastes according to the respondents’ opinion. However, most companies do not have their own or use an established definition of waste, more importantly, very few actively identify or try to eliminate waste in their organizations beyond local initiatives on project level. Conclusion In order to identify, recognize and eliminate waste, a common understanding, and a joint and holistic view of the concept is needed. It is also important to optimize the whole organization and the whole product, as waste on one level can be important on another, thus sub-optimization should be avoided. Furthermore, to achieve a sustainable and effective waste handling, both the short-term and the long-term perspectives need to be considered.

Título: An open science platform for benchmarking engineering design researches
Resumo: In the last fifteen years, several studies showed that a large part of research in engineering design fails to provide objective evidence demonstrating real progress because of a lack of a generally accepted and effective validation environment to test, confirm or refute results. A better validation protocol would highlight the scientific added value on socio-technical systems, facilitate an incremental construction of solutions and improve the recognition of the engineering design research community. Thus, an open science environment for benchmarking engineering design research is proposed. First, a set of guidelines that helps researchers to define the minimum viable content of a benchmark is introduced. Second, the implementation of these guidelines is described in a web-based version-control and collaborative platform within which a community of researchers can engage in the building of a sustainable validation ecosystem. Future works will concentrate on the consolidation of the platform (benchmark examples, instructions, workflows, licenses, etc.) based on the feedback of the current members of the French S.mart special interest group (s-mart.fr) before advertising to a larger community of researchers.

Título: Analysis of key environmental areas in the design and labelling of furniture products: Application of a screening approach based on a literature review of LCA studies
Resumo: Environmental impacts of production and consumption can be controlled and reduced through instruments such as ecodesign and environmental labelling, which typically involve the analysis of complex product systems. The definition of more sustainable product options is not a trivial task and it can be complicated by factors such as the technical complexity and heterogeneity of products, available literature and impact assessment metrics used. The principles of systematic review and meta-analyses have been used to tailor an approach that can be used, to support eco-design and environmental labelling, for screening the environmental literature of products and the preliminary analysis of key environmental areas and improvement options. The approach has been applied to the furniture product group, for which 82 documents related to environmental aspects for different furniture products were collected. The screening and analysis consisted of three steps: 1.selection of reference impact categories;2.screening of studies according to a qualitative–quantitative framework;3.analysis of selected studies and extraction of relevant information. Five impact categories have been analysed: Acidification, Climate Change, Eutrophication, Ozone Depletion, Photochemical Ozone Formation. Analysis of documents covering a broad group of furniture products has allowed the understanding of critical areas, improvement options and technical aspects on which to concentrate investigation efforts in order to reduce the life cycle impacts. The approach can, in general, be adapted to any products for addressing the further development and implementation of measures with which to promote more sustainable options (e.g., ecodesign, environmental labelling, green public procurement criteria).

Título: Application of consumer RGB-D cameras for fruit detection and localization in field: A critical review
Resumo: Fruit detection and localization are essential for future agronomic management of fruit crops such as yield prediction, yield mapping and automated harvesting. However, to perform robust and efficient fruit detection and localization in orchard is a challenging task under variable illumination, low-resolutions and heavy occlusion by neighboring fruits, foliage, or branches. Therefore, researches of fruit detection and localization by getting more information of objects are essential. RGB-D (Red, Green, Blue -Depth) cameras are promising sensors and widely used in fruit detection and localization given that they provide depth information and infrared information in addition to RGB information. After presenting a discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of RGB-D cameras with different depth measurement principles and application fields, this paper reviews various types of RGB-D sensor systems and image processing methods used for fruit detection and localization in the field. Finally, major challenges for the successful application of RGB-D camera-based machine vision system, and potential future directions for the research and development in this area are discussed.

Título: Applying the CRISP-DM data mining process in the financial services industry: Elicitation of adaptation requirements
Resumo: Data mining techniques have gained widespread adoption over the past decades, particularly in the financial services domain. To achieve sustained benefits from these techniques, organizations have adopted standardized processes for managing data mining projects, most notably CRISP-DM. Research has shown that these standardized processes are often not used as prescribed, but instead, they are extended and adapted to address a variety of requirements. To improve the understanding of how standardized data mining processes are extended and adapted in practice, this paper reports on a case study in a financial services organization, aimed at identifying perceived gaps in the CRISP-DM process and characterizing how CRISP-DM is adapted to address these gaps. The case study was conducted based on documentation from a portfolio of data mining projects, complemented by semi-structured interviews with project participants. The results reveal 18 perceived gaps in CRISP-DM alongside their perceived impact and mechanisms employed to address these gaps. The identified gaps are grouped into six categories. Next, they were triangulated and augmented with the gaps discovered in the other studies. Then, the requirements for adapting CRISP-DM to address the gaps were derived, and the directions for the potential adaptations were outlined. The study presents a two-fold contribution. It provides practitioners with a structured set of gaps to be considered when applying CRISP-DM, or similar processes, in the financial services sector. Additionally, the study elicits the requirements and sketches the potential solutions to address these gaps. Also, the number of the identified gaps is generic and applicable to other sectors with similar concerns (e.g. privacy), such as telecom or e-commerce.

Título: AusPlots Rangelands field data collection and publication: Infrastructure for ecological monitoring
Resumo: The TERN AusPlots Rangelands field data collection system has been developed to facilitate simple and efficient data collection by ecologists operating in the Australian outback. The infrastructure provides tooling for ‘clean’ data collection on mobile (tablet) devices, associated data storage in a cloud-based server infrastructure, facilities for data curation and management and interfaces with the Australian Ecological Knowledge and Observation System (ÆKOS) data repository for long-term data management and semantic enrichment. In this paper, we introduce the AusPlots Rangelands field data collection solution, providing a systems-level view and motivating its development through the discussion of key functional requirements. We provide an outline of the ÆKOS data repository and demonstrate that the combined system provides a unique end-to-end data collection, curation, archiving and publishing mechanism for ecological data.

Título: Automation of embodied carbon calculation in digital built environment- tool utilizing UK LCI database
Resumo: Global and governmental pressures have been acting as motivators towards delivering sustainable and low carbon buildings. One of the main sources responsible for carbon in buildings is embodied carbon that depends on material choices. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a methodology developed to assess the materials, using embodied factors throughout the whole life cycle of the material. Although there are promising possibilities for incorporating LCA with building information modelling platforms, dynamic,early design assessment and automated integration still lacking. This paper proposes a novel framework and tool for automating embodied carbon calculations within the BIM environment. The approach leverages literature reviews and hands-on exploration to establish the foundation of a BIM-integrated LCA tool. The proposed tool aims to provide vital information for informed decision-making, minimizing errors, and facilitating low carbon building design. Ultimately, this framework could enhance early decision making, reduce error, time, effort and accelerate iterative design assessment.

Título: Biologicalisation: Biological transformation in manufacturing
Resumo: A new emerging frontier in the evolution of the digitalisation and the 4th industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) is considered to be that of “Biologicalisation in Manufacturing”. This has been defined by the authors to be “The use and integration of biological and bio-inspired principles, materials, functions, structures and resources for intelligent and sustainable manufacturing technologies and systems with the aim of achieving their full potential.” In this White Paper, detailed consideration is given to the meaning and implications of “Biologicalisation” from the perspective of the design, function and operation of products, manufacturing processes, manufacturing systems, supply chains and organisations. The drivers and influencing factors are also reviewed in detail and in the context of significant developments in materials science and engineering. The paper attempts to test the hypothesis of this topic as a breaking new frontier and to provide a vision for the development of manufacturing science and technology from the perspective of incorporating inspiration from biological systems. Seven recommendations are delivered aimed at policy makers, at funding agencies, at the manufacturing research community and at those industries involved in the development of next generation manufacturing technology and systems. It is concluded that it is valid to argue that Biologicalisation in Manufacturing truly represents a new and breaking frontier of digitalisation and Industry 4.0 and that the market potential is very strong. It is evident that extensive research and development is required in order to maximise on the benefits of a biological transformation.

Título: Building Information Modeling (BIM) for transportation infrastructure – Literature review, applications, challenges, and recommendations
Resumo: Transportation infrastructure is a critical component to a nation’s economy, security, and wellbeing. In order to keep up with the rising population, there is a great need for more efficient and cost-effective technologies and techniques to not only repair the infrastructure, but also to advance and expand the transportation infrastructure to sustain the growing population. Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted in the building industry, and its established methods and technologies show enormous potential in benefiting the transportation industry. The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review and critical analysis of BIM for transportation infrastructure. A total of 189 publications in the area of BIM for transportation infrastructure were reviewed, including journal articles, conference proceedings, and published reports. Additionally, schemas and file formats from 9 main categories and 34 areas related to transportation infrastructure were reviewed. An application was developed to collect, store, and analyze the publications. Various algorithms were developed and implemented to help in the automation and analysis of the review. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date literature review and critical analysis of research areas regarding BIM for transportation infrastructure to further facilitate research and applications in this domain. Based on the results of the analysis, current topics and trends, applications and uses, emerging technologies, benefits, challenges and limitations, research gaps, and future needs are discussed. Significantly, the contribution of this paper is providing the foundation of current research, gaps, and emerging technologies needed to facilitate further research and applications for both academia and industry stakeholders to develop more efficient and cost-effective techniques necessary to repair, advance, and expand the transportation infrastructure. Furthermore, the results show that the use of BIM for transportation infrastructure has been increasing, although the research has mainly been focusing on roads, highways, and bridges. The results also reveal a major need for a standard neutral exchange format and schema to promote interoperability. Most importantly, the continuing collaboration between academia and industry is required to mitigate most challenges and to realize the full potential of BIM for transportation infrastructure.

Título: Building information modeling (BIM)-based modular integrated construction risk management – Critical survey and future needs
Resumo: Modular integrated construction (MiC) is an innovative construction technology wherein complete building modules are produced and preassembled in an offsite factory before their final installation on the building site. It is fundamentally different from and has many advantages over the traditional onsite construction technology. However, it still involves several risks. To successfully implement MiC projects, effective MiC risk management (MiCRM) is crucial. Building information modeling (BIM) and BIM-related digital technologies have been applied to facilitate MiCRM in recent years. While numerous MiC studies exist, a critical analysis of BIM-based MiCRM is still missing. This study aims to conduct a critical survey of BIM-based MiCRM, and to offer recommendations about research gaps and future research directions. This was achieved by systematically identifying and critically reviewing related publications from four outlooks: (1) MiCRM through BIM used alone, (2) MiCRM through BIM used alongside sensing and tracking technologies (STTs), (3) MiCRM through BIM used alongside 3D model creation and comparison technologies (3D-MCCTs), and (4) other applications. Results indicated that using BIM alone for MiCRM has focused more on the design phase. The overall idea to use BIM-STTs integration for MiCRM is very young. In this direction, BIM-RFID integration has received most of the attention, although BIM-GIS integration is rarely explored. There are limited works around integrating BIM with 3D-MCCTs such as photogrammetry and augmented and virtual realities for MiCRM. While schedule- and cost-related risks have gained much attention in current BIM-based MiCRM research, facilities management, sustainability, and safety risks are largely ignored. Based upon identified gaps, this study suggested future research directions, including, e.g.: (1) BIM-based MiCRM software development, (2) fully automated and practical BIM-based MiCRM systems development, and (3) BIM-automatic rule checking integration for MiCRM. This study contributes to a solid understanding of BIM-based MiCRM and delivers a useful reference for its future practice and improvement within the industry.

Título: Building sustainable free legal advisory systems: Experiences from the history of AI & law
Resumo: The enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) as a source of solutions to problems is not new. In law, from the early 1980s until at least the early 2000s, considerable work was done on developing ‘legal expert systems.’ As the DataLex project, we participated in those developments, through research and publications, commercial and non-commercial systems, and teaching students application development. This paper commences with a brief account of that work to situate our perspective. The main aim of this paper is an assessment of what might be of value from the experience of the DataLex Project to contemporary use of ‘AI and law’ by free legal advice services, who must necessarily work within funding and other constraints in developing and sustaining such systems. We draw fifteen conclusions from this experience, which we consider are relevant to development of systems for free legal advice services. The desired result, we argue, is the development of integrated legal decision-support systems, not ‘expert systems’ or ‘robot lawyers’. We compare our insights with the approach of the leading recent text in the field, and with a critical review of the field over twenty-five years. We conclude that the approach taken by the DataLex Project, and now applied to free legal advice services, remains consistent with leading work in field of AI and law. The paper concludes with brief suggestions of what are the most desirable improvements to tools and platforms to enable development of free legal advice systems. The objectives of free access to legal information services have much in common with those of free legal advice services. The information resources that free access to law providers (including LIIs) can provide will often be those that free legal advice services will need to use to develop and sustain free legal advisory systems. There is therefore strong potential for valuable collaborations between these two types of services providers.

Título: Capabilities and metrics in DevOps: A design science study
Resumo: Customer demands, competition, regulatory environments, and sophisticated external threats have all increased the importance of DevOps in IT organizations. However, DevOps adoption is still uneven, emphasizing the need to provide management with relevant IS data and insights. Regrettably, there is a measurement inefficiency between these capabilities. To sustain promoting DevOps adoption, Design Science Research (DSR) is done using two multivocal literature reviews and semi-structured interviews to elicit key DevOps metrics and capabilities. Thirty-seven DevOps capabilities and twenty-four metrics were defined, classified, and validated by conducting 31 interviews with practitioners and experts leading to an outcome-based capability evaluation matrix, for promoting DevOps implementation and adoption. Empowering teams and organizational culture have the greatest impact.

Título: Circular Economy Public Policies: A Systematic Literature Review
Resumo: The traditional form of production is called linear economy, which consists of extracting, transforming, producing, consuming and discarding, and is threatened by a series of factors. Among them, we can list the increase in the world population, which went from 3.3 billion people in 1965 to 7.79 billion in 2020, which will consequently lead to an increase in the consumer class. One of the philosophies for meeting this challenge is the Circular Economy (CE), which provides the economic system with an alternative flow model. CE is seen as a new form of sustainability and has gained popularity in the scarcity of resources, the circulation of materials and the facilitation of the reuse and recycling paradigm. Some countries, concerned about the impact of the linear economy on the environment, have proposed specific laws that address the shift from the traditional mode of production to a circular approach. Germany and Japan were pioneers in promoting CE in concrete policies. Followed by China in 2008. Given this scenario, this study aimed to raise which public policies were objects of study in the period 2017 to 2021 and which tools were used to analyze the policies. A systematic review of the literature was carried out, with articles searched in the ScienceDirect and WoS databases, using the descriptors: Circular Economy and Policies. The Sample consisted of 29 articles. The study identified an increase in initiatives to seek circularity through the formulation of public policies. Many countries are demanding more sustainable production processes, with an emphasis on energy savings and fewer carbon emissions. For this, a waste treatment policy is an initial step to seek greater degrees of circularity. The most used tool to study these policies was Framework 9R. Because with it you have an idea of what initial stage the country is in and what stage can be pursued in the future.

Título: Circular Economy: A Product Life Cycle Perspective on Engineering and Manufacturing Practices
Resumo: Realization of a Circular Economy is paramount to solving global challenges in resource scarcity, sustainable manufacturing, and supply chain uncertainty. A Circular Economy (CE) is an economic system hallmarked by linearity reduction, decoupling of economic growth and resource depletion, and favoring regenerative models that consider sustainability. Growing support for a CE is leading to the proliferation of new economic terms, standards, and research to meet the different goals of CE. However, gaps exist in the formalization of these CE terms, frameworks, and research contributions. This paper provides a system-level context for a CE from the perspective of manufacturing in the product life cycle. We do this using the standard process modeling representation IDEFØ. The main contribution of this work is to provide the general context for a CE system by examining each CE activity involved in the creation of a product, reviewing the current literature, identifying current CE standards status and directions, and discussing CE concepts present in current business practices. This work will act as a reference for identifying gaps in research and standards development for integration of CE in manufacturing practices. Through this work, we identified two opportunities for furthering CE progress: metrics for measuring CE success and a standard CE framework with term definitions.

Título: Context-awareness for the design of Smart-product service systems: Literature review
Resumo: Smart-Product Service Systems (S-PSS) emerge as a novel strategy to integrate smart products with advanced digital capabilities and their related e-services to satisfy user’s needs in highly context-dependent environments. S-PSS has the potential to generate a transition towards more economically, ecologically and socially sustainable practices and business models due to its adaptive capacities. However, being able to exploit the digital capabilities of smart products and their services is still limited in design and even more to improve the user experience. For this reason, this study will focus on the Context-awareness capability that has been defined by multiple scholars as one of the most relevant properties that defines the smartness of a product. Following a systematic literature review approach, this work makes the following contributions: (1) it provides a bibliometric analysis using a cluster keyword map to analyze the most researched topics in S-PSS relevant to the design, user experience and analyze their connections; (2) an analysis of the case studies presented in the literature according to the life cycle of context-aware applications; and (3) establishes a research direction for the user experience and design of the S-PSS.

Título: Continuous Delivery: Overcoming adoption challenges
Resumo: Continuous Delivery (CD) is a relatively new software development approach. Companies that have adopted CD have reported significant benefits. Motivated by these benefits, many companies would like to adopt CD. However, adopting CD can be very challenging for a number of reasons, such as obtaining buy-in from a wide range of stakeholders whose goals may seemingly be different from—or even conflict with—our own; gaining sustained support in a dynamic complex enterprise environment; maintaining an application development team's momentum when their application's migration to CD requires an additional strenuous effort over a long period of time; and so on. To help overcome the adoption challenges, I present six strategies: (1) selling CD as a painkiller; (2) establishing a dedicated team with multi-disciplinary members; (3) continuous delivery of continuous delivery; (4) starting with the easy but important applications; (5) visual CD pipeline skeleton; (6) expert drop. These strategies were derived from four years of experience in implementing CD at a multi-billion-euro company. Additionally, our experience led to the identification of eight further challenges for research. The information contributes toward building a body of knowledge for CD adoption.

Título: Creating a sustainable digital infrastructure: The role of service-oriented architecture
Resumo: The United Nations’ goal of generating sustainable industry, innovation, and infrastructure is the point of departure for our reflective paper. The paper elaborates on the concepts of digital infrastructure, service-oriented architecture, and microservices. It emphasizes the benefits and challenges of creating a sustainable infrastructure based on a service-oriented environment, in which cloud services constitute an important part. We outline the prerequisites for obtaining a sustainable digital infrastructure based on services. Service-oriented architecture (SOA) and recently, microservice architecture, and cloud services, can provide organizations with the improved agility and flexibility essential for generating sustainability in a market focusing on digitalization. The reuse capability of SOA provides a common pool of information technology (IT) resources and qualifies as a green IT approach that impacts environmental protection. Previous research has identified IT and business alignment together with SOA governance as the most critical criteria when implementing SOA. This paper discusses these issues in-depth to explain sustainability.

Título: Critical Care Health Informatics Collaborative (CCHIC): Data, tools and methods for reproducible research: A multi-centre UK intensive care database
Resumo: Objective To build and curate a linkable multi-centre database of high resolution longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) from adult Intensive Care Units (ICU). To develop a set of open-source tools to make these data ‘research ready’ while protecting patient’s privacy with a particular focus on anonymisation. Materials and methods We developed a scalable EHR processing pipeline for extracting, linking, normalising and curating and anonymising EHR data. Patient and public involvement was sought from the outset, and approval to hold these data was granted by the NHS Health Research Authority’s Confidentiality Advisory Group (CAG). The data are held in a certified Data Safe Haven. We followed sustainable software development principles throughout, and defined and populated a common data model that links to other clinical areas. Results Longitudinal EHR data were loaded into the CCHIC database from eleven adult ICUs at 5 UK teaching hospitals. From January 2014 to January 2017, this amounted to 21,930 and admissions (18,074 unique patients). Typical admissions have 70 data-items pertaining to admission and discharge, and a median of 1030 (IQR 481–2335) time-varying measures. Training datasets were made available through virtual machine images emulating the data processing environment. An open source R package, cleanEHR, was developed and released that transforms the data into a square table readily analysable by most statistical packages. A simple language agnostic configuration file will allow the user to select and clean variables, and impute missing data. An audit trail makes clear the provenance of the data at all times. Discussion Making health care data available for research is problematic. CCHIC is a unique multi-centre longitudinal and linkable resource that prioritises patient privacy through the highest standards of data security, but also provides tools to clean, organise, and anonymise the data. We believe the development of such tools are essential if we are to meet the twin requirements of respecting patient privacy and working for patient benefit. Conclusion The CCHIC database is now in use by health care researchers from academia and industry. The ‘research ready' suite of data preparation tools have facilitated access, and linkage to national databases of secondary care is underway.

Título: Crowdsourced last-mile delivery with parcel lockers
Resumo: Crowdshipping is increasingly known as a sustainable solution to address the challenges of last mile delivery (LMD) in urban areas. While employing the crowd to perform LMD appears to be an operationally and financially appealing model, it comes with several challenges in practice, including low willingness to participate in delivery work due to low financial incentive and additional travel effort. Inspired by the Physical Internet concept, in this paper we propose a novel crowdsourced LMD problem and solution approach, which allows a delivery task to be performed by one or multiple crowdshippers using parcel lockers as exchange points. The utilisation of parcel lockers in a crowdshipping network allows for shorter trip detour and better geographical coverage. To achieve this objective, we develop a novel model for locating parcel lockers and allocating delivery tasks. A two-phase algorithm is then developed to rank and choose parcel lockers from the potential locations, which first classifies jobs into single and joint delivery sets and then scores each prospective locker by its utilisation in cooperative delivery. A second algorithm is then designed with three selection strategies of random, roulette, and inverse roulette to assign jobs to crowdshippers for single or joint delivery. To evaluate the performance of the algorithms, experiments were conducted in small and large instances based on a real-world case study. While the exact solution was only capable to deal with small-sized problems, the proposed algorithms were able to produce (sub-)optimal results with significantly low computational expenses. Numerical analyses conducted on large instances showed that enabling joint delivery can improve the success delivery rate by up to 5%, which can be achieved by having a small number of parcel lockers hired at ‘critical’ locations.

Título: Demand responsive transport: Generation of activity patterns from mobile phone network data to support the operation of new mobility services
Resumo: Demand Responsive Transport (DRT), covering the first/last mile of a journey, plays a pivotal role in the delivery of a seamless integrated door-to-door service, which is a fundamental requirement for the implementation of Mobility as a Service (MaaS). Business models currently in use do not deliver sustainable and durable DRT in urban areas. This can be minimised using transport modelling tools ahead of the operation phase. However, transport models are not fit for purpose when it comes to model on-demand shared mobility services and the integration of these services in a complex public transport ecosystem. This paper focuses on how to model demand for ride-shared mobility services and how to plan for these services when running in integration with mass transit. An Agent Based Model (ABM), built in the open-source Multi-Agent Transport Simulation (MatSim) platform for Bristol (UK), has used an activity-based approach to model demand for two New Mobility Services (NMS). This was then generated using anonymised and aggregated Mobile phone Network Dataset (MND), both as a trip-based and trip chains dataset to assess the capabilities of MND. Results show that the simulations built using the trip chains MND datasets (722,752 agents generated) lead to better insights in users’ travel patterns. An advanced method using additional data sources covering land-use (location of business, services and transport facilities) was used to infer purpose and mode of transport during the multimodal journeys. The output of the ABM predicts demand for two flexible on-demand services, identifying best routes to maximise the number of users served and quantifying the benefits in the integration with public transport services and in modal shift from private cars. This is expected to be useful either for Local Authorities for transport planning purposes, and for operators looking at financially sustainable DRT.

Título: Design and implementation of a smart infrastructure digital twin
Resumo: There is a critical need to make infrastructure systems more efficient, resilient, and sustainable. Infrastructure systems provide the basis for everyday life and enable the flow of goods, information, and services within urban and regional settings. Providing data-centric solutions to improve this flow is essential. This can only be achieved if we manage to transform passive infrastructure assets into cyber-physical systems. Digital twins bring the opportunity to turn passive infrastructure assets into data-centric systems of systems. This article aims to provide a summary of existing digital twin architectures and exemplify a digital twin design and implementation. To this end, a literature review of digital twin architecture is presented in addition to a case study of a digital twin implementation in smart infrastructure. The case study focuses on a digital twin implementation of a bridge and describes in detail the physical, cyber, integration, and service layers of this implementation. Later in the article, we discuss the learnings from this case study under three main categories – systems perspective, information perspective, and organisational perspective. The findings show the importance of acquiring a systems perspective when designing digital twins today to enable interoperable systems of systems in the future. Furthermore, the findings highlight the vital necessity of data and information management while also considering the multidisciplinary aspects of digital twin design and implementation.

Título: Design from detail: Analyzing data from a global day of coderetreat
Resumo: Context Coderetreats are reflective communities of practice, where participants congregate informally to apply their coding abilities to a clearly defined problem setting with the aim of developing their software design skills. One of these events is the global day of coderetreat (GDCR) involving more than two thousand software developers worldwide. Objective The GDCR provided an opportunity to explore the ways that the coderetreat activity is perceived by its participants as a medium for reflective practice, and to suggest ways that we can enhance the design of coderetreats for improving both the experience and learning outcomes. Method We conducted both quantitative and qualitative surveys from a number of participants in the GDCR to understand how software developers hone their craft in the context of a coderetreat. Results Our study indicates that future coderetreats, particularly those that are likely to attract less experienced developers, should consider providing more structural scaffolding to the initial processes of test driven development. Conclusion We believe that all coderetreats should more explicitly encourage practice and reflection on the four elements of simple design. We suggest a more sustained approach throughout the coderetreat with provision of more structural scaffolding. Accordingly, we have derived a set of recommended practices to make the coderetreat more effective for less experienced developers.

Título: Designing value-driven solutions: The evolution of industrial product-service systems
Resumo: Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS²) have been increasingly researched and practiced in a variety of fields and sectors. Nevertheless, such solutions are not as significantly implemented as expected by the CIRP keynote in 2010: it is not a dominant business of manufacturing companies today despite their economic and environmental advantages. One reason for this delay is assumed to be that the initial efforts were mainly on business and service when design was an afterthought. The promising digital technologies that have become easily implementable in practice will in the next years facilitate design and implementation of IPS² smartly to satisfy users and contribute to sustainability. This keynote analyses literature and practice in the last decade, aiming to propose the main characteristics of IPS² of the future and design processes adequate for IPS². The design process of both production systems for sustainability and high-value systems for sustainable development goals may need to be supported differently than today. The list of recommendations for future research on IPS² design is provided at the end of the paper.

Título: Development and evaluation of ontology for intelligent decision support in medical emergency management for mass gatherings
Resumo: Conducting a safe and successful major event highly depends on the effective provision of medical emergency services that are often offered by different public and private agencies. Poor communication and coordination between these agencies and teams can result in delays in decision-making and duplication of efforts. Another related issue is that emergency decisions are usually made based on individual experience and domain knowledge of relevant managerial personnel. For sustainable knowledge management and more intelligent decision support it is beneficial to collect, consolidate, store and share these experiences in a form of a knowledge base or domain ontology. State-of-the-art surveys identify this gap that there is no common ontology describing the domain knowledge for planning and managing medical services in mass gatherings. Part of the reason is that the process of construction of such an ontology is not a trivial task. In this paper, we describe the process of developing and evaluating a Domain Ontology for Mass Gatherings (DO4MG) with a focus on medical emergency management. As part of the evaluation, we illustrate the application of DO4MG for implementing a case-based reasoning decision support for emergency medical management in mass gatherings. Such an implementation demonstrates the potential of using ontology for resolving terminology inconsistencies and their usefulness for supporting communication between medical emergency personnel in mass gatherings. We also illustrate how this ontology can be applied to different stages of medical emergency management as part of a system architecture. The lessons learnt from building DO4MG for this domain could be beneficial in general to the theory and practice of intelligent decision support and knowledge management in complex problem domains.

Título: Development and national scale implementation of an open-source electronic laboratory information system (OpenELIS) in Côte d’Ivoire: Sustainability lessons from the first 13 years
Resumo: Purpose Côte d'Ivoire has a tiered public health laboratory system of 9 reference laboratories, 77 laboratories at regional and general hospitals, and 100 laboratories among 1,486 district health centers. Prior to 2009, nearly all of these laboratories used paper registers and reports to collect and report laboratory data to clinicians and national disease monitoring programs. Project Since 2009 the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Côte d'Ivoire has sought to implement a comprehensive set of activities aimed at strengthening the laboratory system. One of these activities is the sustainable development, expansion, and technical support of an open-source electronic laboratory information system (OpenELIS), with the long-term goal of Ivorian technical support and managerial sustainment of the system. This project has addressed the need for a comprehensive, customizable, low- to no-cost, open-source LIS to serve the public health systems with initial attention to HIV clients and later expansion to cover the general population. This descriptive case study presents the first published summary of original work which has been ongoing since 2009 in Côte d’Ivoire to transform the laboratory information management systems and processes nationally. Impact OpenELIS is now in use at 106 laboratories across Côte d’Ivoire. This article describes the iterative planning, design, and implementation process of OpenELIS in Côte d'Ivoire, and the evolving leadership, ownership, and capacity of the Ivorian MOH in sustaining the system. This original work synthesizes lessons learned from this 13-year experience towards strengthening laboratory information systems in other low resource settings.

Título: Development of a framework for the holistic generation of ML-based business models in manufacturing
Resumo: Analyzing data with the help of Machine Learning (ML) promises to raise significant potentials in all relevant target dimensions and different application fields of industrial production. Through the increasing availability of data in the context of digitalization as well as continuously more powerful and cost-effective possibilities for data processing, the amount of economically viable scenarios for implementing ML-based business models (BMs) in production rises. Despite the emerging data-related possibilities, especially small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) struggle with identifying reasonable use cases for ML in their own company. This can be ascribed to a lack of knowledge about the necessary elements for ML applications’ sustainable implementation and operation. Therefore, this paper aims to develop a framework for the holistic generation of ML-based BMs in manufacturing. At first, characteristics as well as general and specific requirements for ML-based BMs in manufacturing are elaborated. Subsequently, a morphology for the systematic development of ML-based BMs is generated using the insights gained. In a concluding step, the application of the developed concept is validated based on a selected use case.

The purpose of this paper is to critically review the current state of the art in digitalizing animal agriculture with Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) technologies, specifically biometric sensors, big data, and blockchain technology. Biometric sensors include either noninvasive or invasive sensors that monitor an individual animal’s health and behavior in real time, allowing farmers to integrate this data for population-level analyses. Real-time information from biometric sensors is processed and integrated using big data analytics systems that rely on statistical algorithms to sort through large, complex data sets to provide farmers with relevant trending patterns and decision-making tools. Sensors enabled blockchain technology affords secure and guaranteed traceability of animal products from farm to table, a key advantage in monitoring disease outbreaks and preventing related economic losses and food-related health pandemics. Thanks to PLF technologies, livestock agriculture has the potential to address the abovementioned pressing concerns by becoming more transparent and fostering increased consumer trust. However, new PLF technologies are still evolving and core component technologies (such as blockchain) are still in their infancy and insufficiently validated at scale. The next generation of PLF technologies calls for preventive and predictive analytics platforms that can sort through massive amounts of data while accounting for specific variables accurately and accessibly. Issues with data privacy, security, and integration need to be addressed before the deployment of multi-farm shared PLF solutions becomes commercially feasible.

Título: Digital maturity model for research and development organization with the aspect of sustainability.
Resumo: Many organizations are trying to assess how they progress on their digital transformation journey. One of the methods to assess this progress is to apply the concept of digital maturity. In this article authors describe how they discovered the need to develop a digital maturity model tailored to research and development organizations and share their experience from testing the first version of this model. Digital maturity can be assessed to determine the current state of the organization and to develop roadmaps helping organizations evolve and respond to market dynamics. The authors firmly believe that there is no responsible digitalization without considering the dimension of sustainability and therefore they included it in their maturity model. A digitally transformed company becomes more efficient, generates less waste, and uses fewer resources, which makes it more sustainable.

Título: Digital twins in condition-based maintenance apps: A case study for train axle bearings
Resumo: Digital Twins (DTs) are gaining popularity in the context of the fourth industrial revolution to replicate physical equipment and systems in the digital world. DTs promise increased productivity and sustainable performance by integrating data, models, and decision-support systems. However, before realizing the potential benefits of DTs for maintenance management, several challenges need to be addressed, including a lack of conceptual basis, functional description, and established requirements. Hence, the paper presents, in a practical manner, how to cover this gap in digital configurations for maintenance management, designed to benefit of DTs. The scope of the paper includes the design and implementation of an innovative condition-based maintenance application (CBM App) based on a DT of train axle bearings, and uses a generic framework for digital maintenance management for the functional description of the DT within the CBM App. The paper provides details of the models and algorithms used to build the DT and ensures that recommended features are fulfilled. To test the DT's effectiveness and robustness, the design and framework are implemented in real CBM applications of TALGO, a high-speed train manufacturer. These tools are deemed helpful for easing DT implementation within the CBM App and can be replicated in other operational contexts.

Título: Digital Twins in greenhouse horticulture: A review
Resumo: Digital Twins can be considered as a new phase in smart and data-driven greenhouse horticulture. A Digital Twin is a digital equivalent to a real-life object of which it mirrors its behaviour and states over its lifetime in a virtual space. Research indicates that they can substantially enhance productivity and sustainability, and are able to deal with the increasing scarcity of green labour in greenhouse horticulture. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review on Digital Twin applications in greenhouse horticulture. The review identifies 8 articles that explicitly address Digital Twins in greenhouse horticulture and 115 studies that implicitly apply the Digital Twin concept in smart IoT-based systems. Findings indicate that the concept of the Digital Twin is in a seminal phase in greenhouse horticulture, but there are existing applications that are not yet framed as Digital Twins. In the reviewed papers, there is a dominant focus on the cultivation process at the greenhouse level, among others for climate control, energy management and lighting. About 9% of the articles are virtualizing plants themselves, which indicates that the granularity level addressed is still rather limited. Only 7 % of the articles look beyond plants or single greenhouses. None of the reviewed articles consider the company level. Furthermore, most applications address monitoring and control of the state and behaviour of real-life objects. More advanced applications, including predictive and prescriptive capabilities across the complete lifecycle, are still in an early stage of development, although predictive Digital Twins are gaining prominence.

Título: Drivers, barriers and impacts of digitalisation in rural areas from the viewpoint of experts
Resumo: Context: The domain of rural areas, including rural communities, agriculture, and forestry, is going through a process of deep digital transformation. Digitalisation can have positive impacts on sustainability in terms of greater environmental control, and community prosperity. At the same time, it can also have disruptive effects, with the marginalisation of actors that cannot cope with the change. When developing a novel system for rural areas, requirements engineers should carefully consider the specific socio-economic characteristics of the domain, so that potential positive effects can be maximised, while mitigating negative impacts. Objective: The goal of this paper is to support requirements engineers with a reference catalogue of drivers, barriers and potential impacts associated to the introduction of novel ICT solutions in rural areas. Method: To this end, we interview 30 cross-disciplinary experts in digitalisation of rural areas, and we analyse the transcripts to identify common themes. Results: According to the experts, main drivers are economic, with the possibility of reducing costs, and regulatory, as institutions push for more precise tracing and monitoring of production; barriers are the limited connectivity, but also distrust towards technology and other socio-cultural aspects; positive impacts are socio-economic (e.g., reduction of manual labour, greater productivity), while negative ones include potential dependency from technology, with loss of hands-on expertise, and marginalisation of certain actors (e.g., small farms, subjects with limited education). Conclusion: This paper contributes to the literature with a domain-specific catalogue that characterises digitalisation in rural areas. The catalogue can be used as a reference baseline for requirements elicitation endeavours in rural areas, to support domain analysis prior to the development of novel solutions, as well as fit-gap analysis for the adaptation of existing technologies.

Título: Empathy of Project Management Students and Why It Matters
Resumo: Empathy’s role in developing relationships suggests its potential as a key skill for project managers leading teams and managing stakeholders. What is perhaps less well recognized in project management is the role empathy can play in ensuring sustainability within a competitive work market and in ensuring resilience and wellbeing. The Davis Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI), which measures self-reported empathy against four dimensions including perspective taking (PT), empathic concern (EC), personal distress (PD) and fantasy scale (FS), was used to measure empathy levels of Australian Master of Project Management students. Students subsequently shared their views of empathy in project management. The empathy scores were compared to those of students from other disciplines reported in the literature including health professions of medical, nursing and midwifery, animal science, and criminal justice students. The results suggest that relative to other student cohorts, project management students score lowest in all dimensions of empathy except for perspective taking where they are second lowest to medical students. Implications are discussed including calls for project management curriculum to focus on empathy-based skills, as well as possible considerations for project managers to consider empathy in their practice to improve project manager wellbeing.

Título: Empirical evaluation of two best practices for energy-efficient software development
Resumo: Background. Energy efficiency is an increasingly important property of software. A large number of empirical studies have been conducted on the topic. However, current state-of-the-Art does not provide empirically-validated guidelines for developing energy-efficient software. Aim. This study aims at assessing the impact, in terms of energy savings, of best practices for achieving software energy efficiency, elicited from previous work. By doing so, it identifies which resources are affected by the practices and the possible trade-offs with energy consumption. Method. We performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment, where we applied two different Green Software practices to two software applications, namely query optimization in MySQL Server and usage of “sleep” instruction in the Apache web server. We then performed a comparison of the energy consumption at system-level and at resource-level, before and after applying the practice. Results. Our results show that both practices are effective in improving software energy efficiency, reducing consumption up to 25%. We observe that after applying the practices, resource usage is more energy-proportional i.e., increasing CPU usage increases energy consumption in an almost linear way. We also provide our reflections on empirical experimentation in software energy efficiency. Conclusions. Our contribution shows that significant improvements in software energy efficiency can be gained by applying best practices during design and development. Future work will be devoted to further validate best practices, and to improve their reusability.

Título: EUDability: A new construct at the intersection of End-User Development and Computational Thinking
Resumo: The sustainable and digital future of work may imply a dramatic equilibrium change between social factors and technological ones. We argue that providing suitable tools to support End-User Development (EUD) in the workplace could represent a way to cope with such future changes. The contributions of this paper include the analysis and characterization of the most used EUD techniques and their crossover with a new conveyed model of Computational Thinking. The synthesis between these aspects is made explicit in the construct of EUDability, which is designed to capture the quality dimensions of EUD systems suitable to work scenarios where better roles and better tools for individuals may be shaped. EUDability has to do with identifying and assessing the difficulties of EUD techniques on one side and the Computational Thinking skills held by individuals on the other side.

Título: Evaluating the characteristics of a non-standardised Model Requirements Analysis (MRA) for the development of policy impact assessment tools
Resumo: The aim of this paper is to provide a critical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of a non-standardised Model Requirements Analysis (MRA) used for the purpose of developing the Sustainability Impact Assessment Tool (SIAT). By ‘non-standardised’ we mean not strictly following a published MRA method. The underlying question we are interested in addressing is how non-standardised methods, often employed in research driven projects, compare to defined methods with more standardised structure, with regards their ability to capture model requirements effectively, and with regards their overall usability. Through describing and critically assessing the specific features of the non-standardised MRA employed, the ambition of this paper is to provide insights useful for impact assessment tool (IAT) development. Specifically, the paper will (i) characterise kinds of user requirements relevant to the functionality and design of IATs; (ii) highlight the strengths and weaknesses of non-standardised MRA for user requirements capture, analysis and reflection in the context of IAT; (iii) critically reflect on the process and outcomes of having used a non-standardised MRA in comparison with other more standardised approaches. To accomplish these aims, we first review methods available for IAT development before describing the SIAT development process, including the MRA employed. Major strengths and weaknesses of the MRA method are then discussed in terms of user identification and characterisation, organisational characterisation and embedding, and ability to capture design options for ensuring usability and usefulness. A detailed assessment on the structural differences of MRA with two advanced approaches (Integrated DSS design and goal directed design) and their role in performance of the MRA tool is used to critique the approach employed. The results show that MRA is able to bring thematic integration, establish system performance and technical thresholds as well as detailing quality and transparency guidelines. Nevertheless the discussion points out to a number of deficiencies in application - (i) a need to more effectively characterise potential users, and; (ii) a need to better foster communication among the distinguished roles in the development process. If addressed these deficiencies, SIAT non-standardised MRA could have brought out better outcomes in terms of tool usability and usefulness, and improved embedding of the tool into conditions of targeted end-users.

Título: Factors Hindering Business-IT Alignment in Small and Medium Enterprises in China
Resumo: Business-IT alignment (BITA) continues to be important for organizations and has received a considerable attention during the last 25 years from academic research. The organizational size has already been found to affect business-IT alignment but there are still a fewer research studies exploring BITA in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) compared with those studies done on large-size companies. Moreover the previous research studies have less focused on understanding the existing factors hindering BITA in SMEs particularly in China. Especially in regards to China, where there are millions of SMEs that are facing different challenges in achieving and sustaining their business-IT alignment. Therefore, case studies have been conducted in three SMEs in China that have no more than 250 employees and their turnover does not exceed 50 million annually. The data has been collected through semi-structured interviews with managers in these SMEs and also from SMEs internal documents and then analyzed thematically. The results of this study are a number of 26 factors hindering BITA in SMEs in China including seven new factors that are hindering BITA in these SMEs. The findings of this study could help researchers but also business and IT practitioners to understand the factors that are hindering BITA in Chinese SMEs and the actions to be taken for aligning business and IT strategy.

Título: Factors that affect developers’ decision to participate in a Mobile Software Ecosystem
Resumo: In Mobile Software Ecosystem (MSECO), external developers build applications that meet the interest of users of mobile technologies. Researchers claim that MSECO sustainability depends on two capabilities: adoption of new technologies over time, and attraction and maintenance of people (i.e., developers and users) participating in these ecosystems. Our research focuses on the latter. We investigated factors that affect developers’ decision to participate in an MSECO. First, we analyzed the literature to identify such motivational factors. Second, we interviewed experts in MSECO aiming to refine the identified factors. Finally, we also conducted interviews to identify the opinion of MSECO developers regarding the refined list of factors. The final list of 29 factors were discussed, one by one, by the 20 interviewees. Each developer indicated which factor motivated him/her to join a certain MSECO and also which has kept him/her contributing to it. Results indicate that the lack of studies focusing on developers, not just on technologies or business rules of the ecosystem, is a key for understanding developers’ decision to participate in an MSECO. Moreover, developers become more concerned with their relationships in these ecosystems over time. As such, ou research contributes to the MSECO field with a list of motivating factors that should be considered by external developers from ecosystems towards MSECO sustainability.

Título: Fleet management enterprise systems and traffic control synergies: a literature review and research agenda
Resumo: Synergies between fleet management enterprise systems and traffic control systems for information sharing and collaborative planning can contribute to significant improvements to operational efficiency, safety and environmental impact. This paper provides a synthesis of the extant body of research on synergies between fleet management and traffic control systems identifying five key topics in prior research and suggesting research directions. The findings are based on a systematic literature review and topic modelling with the use of natural language processing (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). The five topics identified are related to: hazardous goods transportation, environment and emissions, position tracking and navigation technologies, traffic management and fleet operations´ optimization. The two most frequent topics link to social responsibility (minimizing accidents during hazardous goods transportation and minimizing environmental impact) indicating the relevance of this area of research to sustainability. Despite the strong potential for synergies between intelligent transportation systems and enterprise fleet management systems, the review identified a paucity of research on the coordination between real-time fleet management and traffic control measures (e.g. ramp metering, route guidance, variable speed limits and signal control).

Título: Fostering economic growth, social inclusion & sustainability in Industry 4.0: a systemic approach
Resumo: The most modern and mature industrial manufacturing revolution is known as Industry 4.0 (I4.0). Technological advance seeks to minimize all sorts of waste, optimizing the firm’s performance operations aligning this its competitive advantage. While in developing economies often overlooked the society and environment under the current neoliberalism strategy, whose competitive approach is enforced by the State, with a detriment of local SMEs such as Mexico. Thereby, to lead I4.0 implementation for SMEs, the role of the State for a long-term strategic approach is of utmost importance. The industrial strategy should regard the imminent industrial revolution without leaving behind environmental and social dimensions to implement it, like the Scandinavian economies example. This research proposes the soft systems methodology for dealing with the sustainable complexity context and inclusive industrial development phenomena. Its holistic nature provides useful insights that devise how I4.0 and social inclusion fit into the Mexican context. The theoretical proposal builds upon the social inclusion state-of-the-art in the industry 4.0 and a survey for an affordable I4.0 initiative through a stakeholder system’s network communication approach. The inclusive strategy is an effort to align root systems for sustainable development with stakeholders for Mexican SMEs in the manufacturing sector.

Título: From Factory of the Future to Future of the Factory: Integration Approaches
Resumo: Nowadays, manufacturing systems transform themselves to become Factories of the Future (FoF) that is to say highly flexible, rapidly adaptable to external changes and aiming for a high degree of sustainability. This trend has generated several research streams that we analyse in this paper through a deep bibliographical review. This review leads us to conceptualize 3 main approaches: Computer Integrated Manufacturing, role of human work force and other integration approaches. A potential issue identified within the research is the interplay between computer-based and organization based approaches to manage the dynamic interactions among product, processes and production systems. The conclusions and orientations of future works are thus outlined to support the development of this co-evolution perspective for the successful transformation of Factories.

Título: Gamification in IoT Application: A Systematic Mapping Study
Resumo: We are entering an era where everything is almost connected. According to Gartner, "we expect to see 20 billion internet-connected things by 2020". This evolution has engendered a colossal amount of data that traditional computer applications could no longer handle. We penetrate the epoch of smart applications: intelligent, contextual and proactive. On the other side, a trend that makes the hype is Gamification. It is now being applied to several domains especially those that targets human engagement, performance and sustainability. In this paper, through a systematic mapping study, we will present a breadth-first review of search papers that integrate gamification in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The main aim is to provide a historical and geographic classification of research that combines IoT with gamification, the most challenging areas, and the artifacts that come out.

Título: Getting the prices right: Drivers' cruising choices in a serious parking game
Resumo: Scarcity of on-street parking in city centers is a known factor motivating drivers to drive slowly (“to cruise”) while searching for an available parking place and is associated with negative externalities e.g. congestion, accidents, fuel waste, and air pollution. Finding the correct prices is suggested to bring cruising to a sustainable level. Current research methods based on surveys and simulations fail to provide a complete understanding of drivers’ cruising preferences and their behavioral response to price changes. We used the PARKGAME serious game, which provides a real-world abstraction of the dynamic cruising experience. Eighty-three players participated in an experiment under two pricing scenarios. Pricing was spatially designed as “price rings” decreasing when receding from the desired destination point. We analyzed search time, parking distance, parking location choice, and spatial searching patterns. We show that such a pricing policy may substantially reduce the cruising problem, motivating drivers to park earlier—further away from the destination or in the lot, especially when occupancy levels are extremely high. We further discuss the policy implications of these findings.

Título: Green IT Governance and Management based on ISO/IEC 15504
Resumo: Organizations around the world are increasingly concerned about the environment, adopting sustainable practices in their business processes. In the field of Information Technologies (IT) several Green IT practices have been proposed, but in isolation, so a framework is needed if the Green IT is to be implemented and improved in an efficient and integrated way. In this paper, we propose a maturity model (based on ISO/IEC 15504) to help organizations implement the governance and management of Green IT gradually, as well as to improve their maturity level in this area. The validation of this proposal by experts and a case study seems to indicate that the proposal can be useful for implementing and improving the Green IT processes in organizations.

Título: Green IT in small and medium-sized enterprises: A systematic literature review
Resumo: Digital transformation is increasingly necessary for SMEs to take advantage of Information Technologies (IT) to innovate and keep up in the globalized market. In addition, environmental contextualization due to technology is of increasing concern to organizations. Consequently, pollution and climate change are forcing SMEs to incorporate ecological policies, strategies, and practices ranging from the protection of natural resources to renewable energy initiatives for maximum efficiency to the awareness of all stakeholders. Green IT initiatives refer to the need to reduce the impact of technology on the environment. However, the policies, strategies, practices, and models of Green IT applied in SMEs over time has to be explored to know their level of implementation. This research aims to conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) to determine the practices, strategies, policies, and models of Green IT for SMEs. Several studies have been raised regarding Green IT during the last few years and are now compiled in this study. The methodology used was Kitchenham’s, which allowed the extraction of 38 articles from the scientific databases IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science. The results revealed practices, strategies, policies, and models promoting Green IT compliance in SMEs, reducing costs in companies by optimizing technological resources to environmental sustainability.

Título: Green software: Refactoring approach
Resumo: An energy efficient information and communication system is a need of the day. Information technology related industries are making efforts to reduce power consumption by improvising both the hardware infrastructure and software systems. The hardware is driven by software; hence, design and development of software may have a significant impact energy need of the overall system. Many times it is observed that complex software performs useless tasks leading to power consumption, referred to as energy leak. The solution of energy leaks for mobile applications has attracted the interest of researchers, but still handling energy leaks issues for applications developed using Java-based technology need to be explored. While designing software during maintenance phase, code smells are introduced which not only reduce performance of the software also may lead to execution of useless code thus enhancing the energy leak. The common practice of the software industry to remove the code smells is use of refactoring strategy. The basic idea of this study is to understand the impact of refactoring on total energy consumption. To explore this hypothesis a set of Java based applications are selected, code smell present in these applications are discovered and a suitable refactoring strategy is applied to reduce the code smell. Power consumption is estimated using an open source tool Microsoft Joulemeter, it monitors energy usage by machine resources and estimates power consumption. The energy consumption before and after refactoring is recorded and statistical t-test is performed to validate the proposed concept.

Título: Greening existing buildings through Building Information Modelling: A review of the recent development
Resumo: The use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) for green retrofitting is a recent development due to its integrated solutions for evaluating and monitoring the environmental sustainability performance of existing buildings. It can be implemented throughout different stages of building life cycle using centralized digital models. However, the actual applications of such technology are still scarce and require further study and verification. In this paper, a systematic review of the recent development of BIM was conducted on two related areas: (a) existing buildings’ sustainability performance and (b) green retrofitting. The review highlights that little work has been conducted on these two areas concurrently which is mainly at the exploration stage. The results further reveal common BIM sustainability tools, performance parameters and design parameters in the recent research on the green retrofitting of existing buildings. Furthermore, a research framework has been developed to fill the research gaps and future needs in the implementation of BIM for green retrofitting, including data acquisition techniques, integrated process, unified platform, data interoperability and management, level of automation, design alteration as well as auto data feedback. This paper provides new insights into both theoretical developments and practical or technical aspects of BIM in fostering a complete green retrofit ecosystem.

Título: Implementation Potential of Sustainability-oriented Decision Support in Product Development
Resumo: This study aims to identify challenges and opportunities for implementation of sustainability-oriented decision support in product development. A literature review and interviews with field experts were performed. Most methods/tools designed to support sustainability considerations in product development have a low level of implementation. A lack of the full scope of sustainability and poor practical applicability might be reasons. Implementation could be improved by amending these deficiencies. Another opportunity is to integrate sustainability aspects in methods/tools that are often already implemented in companies. A low-hanging fruit can be to focus on the area of risk management together with defining sustainability criteria.

Título: Implications of developing a tool for sustainability screening of circular economy initiatives
Resumo: Circular economy seems to offer abounding opportunities for companies that are seeking to optimize their business practices while reducing the environmental burden. Circular economy therefore is often seen as a stepping-stone towards sustainability. However, to ensure the transition from linear to circular economy in a sustainable way, a shift requires implementation of not only financially beneficial circular strategies, but also environmentally and socially valuable ones. The challenge for companies is to understand how a particular circular initiative in their business context contributes to sustainability and what elements of sustainability have to be assessed prior to the initiative implementation. This paper illustrates how an indicator-based sustainability screening tool for circular economy initiatives can guide companies in their decision making towards a more sustainable circular initiative choice. In addition, the paper highlights challenges of measuring sustainability in a circular economy context.

Título: Improving feature location in long-living model-based product families designed with sustainability goals
Resumo: The benefits of Software Product Lines (SPL) are very appealing: software development becomes better, faster, and cheaper. Unfortunately, these benefits come at the expense of a migration from a family of products to a SPL. Feature Location could be useful in achieving the transition to SPLs. This work presents our FeLLaCaM approach for Feature Location. Our approach calculates similarity to a description of the feature to locate, occurrences where the candidate features remain unchanged, and changes performed to the candidate features throughout the retrospective of the product family. We evaluated our approach in two long-living industrial domains: a model-based family of firmwares for induction hobs that was developed over more than 15 years, and a model-based family of PLC software to control trains that was developed over more than 25 years. In our evaluation, we compare our FeLLaCaM approach with two other approaches for Feature Location: (1) FLL (Feature Location through Latent Semantic Analysis) and (2) FLC (Feature Location through Comparisons). We measure the performance of FeLLaCaM, FLL, and FLC in terms of recall, precision, Matthews Correlation Coefficient, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve. The results show that FeLLaCaM outperforms FLL and FLC.

Título: Incentive techniques for the Internet of Things: A survey
Resumo: The Internet of Things (IoT) has remarkably evolved over the last few years to realize a wide range of newly emerging services and applications empowered by the unprecedented proliferation of smart devices. The quality of IoT networks heavily relies on the involvement of devices for undertaking functions from data sensing, computation to communication and IoT intelligence. Stimulating IoT devices to actively participate and contribute to the network is a practical challenge, where incentive techniques such as blockchain, game theory, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are highly desirable to build a sustainable IoT ecosystem. In this article, we present a systematic literature review of the incentive techniques for IoT, aiming to provide general readers with an overview of incentive-enabled IoT from background, motivations, and enabling techniques. Particularly, we first present the fundamentals of IoT data network infrastructure, and several key incentive techniques for IoT are described in details, including blockchain, game theory, and AI. We next provide an extensive review on the use of these incentive techniques in a number of key IoT services, such as IoT data sharing, IoT data offloading and caching, IoT mobile crowdsensing, and IoT security and privacy. Subsequently, we explore the potential of incentives in important IoT applications, ranging from smart healthcare, smart transportation to smart city and smart industry. The research challenges of incentive techniques in IoT networks are highlighted, and the potential directions are also pointed out for future research of this important area.

However, a knowledge gap exists as the environmental performance of retrofit power plant solutions incorporating emerging technologies has not been examined using an integrated system approach based on Life Cycle Assessment. The purpose of this research was to investigate if integrating selected emerging technologies i.e. photovoltaic systems, lithium-ion batteries, cold ironing and power-take-off/power-take-in systems supplemented by frequency converters and variable frequency drives into an existing power plant would be to the advantage of a chosen ship type i.e. Roll-on/Roll-off cargo ships, from the perspectives of resource consumption and environmental burden. Using the power plant of an existing vessel as a case study, it was found that cast iron, steel, copper and aluminium were the four materials most commonly consumed during manufacturing phase i.e. 2.9×105kg, 1.9×105kg, 5.3×104kg and 2.9×104kg respectively. By burning 2.9×107kg of heavy fuel oil and 2.3×108kg of marine diesel oil during operation, 8.2×108kg of carbon dioxide, 1.7×107kg of nitrogen oxides, 6.1×106kg of sulphur dioxide, 7.6×105kg of carbon monoxide, 6.5×105kg of hydrocarbon and 4.7×105kg of particulate matter would be released. Over a projected 30-year period, emissions released to air and freshwater were found to be significant. Based on 3 characterisation methodologies, ecotoxicity potential, with 7–10 orders of magnitude, was identified as the most significant environmental burden. Consuming and storing resources had the least impact, operating diesel engines and auxiliary generators had a moderate impact, and disposing metallic waste had the highest impact. The research concluded that the environmental burden caused by a marine power plant was significant but retrofitting existing power plant with suitable emerging technologies could reduce a number of impacts by 4–7 orders of magnitude, as verified via scenario analysis. However, the system should be designed and managed with due care as the environmental benefits, such as lower fuel consumption, emission reduction and performance improvement in some environmental measures are always achieved at the expense of an increase in other detrimental impacts.

Título: Investigating the implications of a new-build hybrid power system for Roll-on/Roll-off cargo ships from a sustainability perspective – A life cycle assessment case study
Resumo: Marine transport has been essential for international trade. Concern for its environmental impact was growing among regulators, classification societies, ship operators, ship owners, and other stakeholders. By applying life cycle assessment, this article aimed to assess the impact of a new-build hybrid system (i.e. an electric power system which incorporated lithium ion batteries, photovoltaic systems and cold-ironing) designed for Roll-on/Roll-off cargo ships. The study was carried out based on a bottom-up integrated system approach using the optimised operational profile and background information for manufacturing processes, mass breakdown and end of life management plans. Resources such as metallic and non-metallic materials and energy required for manufacture, operation, maintenance, dismantling and scrap handling were estimated. During operation, 1.76×108kg of marine diesel oil was burned, releasing carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide which ranged 5–8 orders of magnitude. The operation of diesel gensets was the primary cause of impact categories that were relevant to particulate matter or respiratory inorganic health issues, photochemical ozone creation, eutrophication, acidification, global warming and human toxicity. Disposing metallic scrap was accountable for the most significant impact category, ecotoxicity potential. The environmental benefits of the hybrid power system in most impact categories were verified in comparison with a conventional power system onboard cargo ships. The estimated results for individual impact categories were verified using scenario analysis. The study concluded that the life cycle of a new-build hybrid power system would result in significant impact on the environment, human beings and natural reserves, and therefore proper management of such a system was imperative.

Título: IT-Business Alignment: A Systematic Literature Review
Resumo: IT-business alignment has been the focus for top managers in the last two decades. Literature reported IT-business alignment as one of the key enablers for the success of IT in an organization. Given its importance, this study aimed at exploring the reported benefits of IT-business alignment, the proposed methodologies and the challenges in implementing these models. To do so, a systematic literature review was conducted to find answers to these questions. This study reveals that applying IT in an appropriate and timely way, in harmony with business strategies, goals and needs can result in plenty of benefits for an organization. These benefits include enhanced cooperation among members, competitive advantage, performance enhancement, high return on investment, facilitation of processes and growth among others. In fact, IT today is not only a tool but has become a business enabler delivering values for organization and this implies that huge investment on IT must be well managed and controlled in order to align IT with business. Also, the study reviewed some proposed methodologies or models that have contributed in achieving sustained alignment between business and IT. Lastly, the study reveals that, despite the inevitable benefits, there are still some difficulties or challenges organizations faced in establishing an atmosphere of honesty and humility between IT and business. These challenges are lack of effective communication, low return on IT investments, lack of the necessary skills to adapt to changes in technology or conflicting priorities.

Título: It’s about time: How to study intertemporal choice in systems design
Resumo: Context: Decision making pervades software and systems engineering. Intertemporal decisions involve trade-offs among outcomes at different points in time. They play a central role in systems design, as recognised since the inception of the software engineering (SE) field. They are also crucial for the sustainability of design decisions. However, temporal decision making is not adequately understood in SE. The field of Judgement and Decision Making (JDM) offers important empirical findings and research methods that could be utilised. Objective: This article establishes a baseline for studying how software professionals handle intertemporal choices. It examines how temporal distance affects choices in an example scenario, explores in what areas of software development such decisions can be found, and examines how systems design decisions can be characterised and studied as intertemporal. Method: We developed a method to study intertemporal choice in SE, based on an initial set of psychological theory grounded in JDM. We instantiated the method in a study to elicit responses to an intertemporal choice task followed by a Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) interview. Results: We found that study participants overall tended to discount future outcomes, but individual participants varied wildly in how they valued present vs. future outcomes. They indicated several locations in which intertemporal choices occur in everyday software development. Based on these findings, and by reconciling our initial theory with existing JDM theory and results, we further developed and refined our theory and study method into a framework for studying intertemporal decision making in SE. Conclusions: To obtain a basis for more sustainable software systems design decisions, SE research should adopt a more comprehensive, detailed, and empirically consistent way of understanding and studying intertemporal choices. We provide suggestions for how future research could achieve practical methods that address essential characteristics of real-life systems design decisions.

Título: Leveraging industry 4.0 – A business model pattern framework
Resumo: Industry 4.0 (I4.0), also known as the fourth industrial revolution, describes the digitalization of manufacturing industries. The transition to I4.0 is crucial for manufacturing firms to sustain competitive advantage and seize new opportunities. Most research has focused on the technological aspects of I4.0 in the form of product and process innovations. Despite I4.0's rising attention from both researchers and practitioners, little research exists about I4.0 business model (BM) innovation, even though BM innovations can be more successful than product or process innovations. To address this research gap, we analyze 32 case studies of I4.0 BM innovators. We develop a taxonomy to characterize I4.0 BMs and derive 13 patterns of I4.0 BMs by applying the taxonomy to the case studies. Three super-patterns are identified: integration, servitization, and expertization. Integration innovates a BM with new processes and integrates parts of the supply chain. New combined products and services are the basis for servitization. Expertization is a hybrid of product- and process-focused BMs, which includes consulting services and multi-sided platforms. This study contributes to research with a framework for describing, analyzing, and classifying BMs for I4.0. The findings deepen the understanding of how I4.0 impacts ecosystem roles, BMs, and service systems. Archetypal patterns show how firms can leverage I4.0 concepts and build a conceptual basis for future research. The taxonomy supports practitioners in evaluating the I4.0-readiness of their existing BM. The patterns additionally illustrate opportunities for becoming an I4.0 firm.

Título: Maintaining interoperability in open source software: A case study of the Apache PDFBox project
Resumo: Software interoperability is commonly achieved through the implementation of standards for communication protocols or data representation formats. Standards documents are often complex, difficult to interpret, and may contain errors and inconsistencies, which can lead to differing interpretations and implementations that inhibit interoperability. Through a case study of two years of activity in the Apache PDFBox project we examine day-to-day decisions made concerning implementation of the PDF specifications and standards in a community open source software (OSS) project. Thematic analysis is used to identify semantic themes describing the context of observed decisions concerning interoperability. Fundamental decision types are identified including emulation of the behaviour of dominant implementations and the extent to which to implement the PDF standards. Many factors influencing the decisions are related to the sustainability of the project itself, while other influences result from decisions made by external actors, including the developers of dependencies of PDFBox. This article contributes a fine grained perspective of decision-making about software interoperability by contributors to a community OSS project. The study identifies how decisions made support the continuing technical relevance of the software, and factors that motivate and constrain project activity.

Título: Managing inter-organizational knowledge sharing
Resumo: Corporate knowledge is considered a crucial determinant of sustainable competitive advantages. Recent resource-leveraging strategies emphasize inter-firm collaboration and knowledge sharing across firm boundaries, however. This strategic paradox of protecting versus sharing knowledge suggests the need for new paradigms that reconcile intra- and inter-organizational knowledge sharing. Building on organizational collaboration and control theory, this paper investigates contingencies of inter-organizational knowledge sharing and proposes four configurations of inter-organizational knowledge sharing for managing the paradox. It concludes with a critical review, suggestions for further conceptual and empirical research, and implications for research and practice.

Título: Maturity assessment for Industry 5.0: A review of existing maturity models
Resumo: With the introduction of Industry 5.0, a new paradigm shift is planned. Whereas Industry 4.0 is still focused primarily on economic objectives to be achieved through digital transformation and automation of monotonous work processes, Industry 5.0 will also bring in social and ecological objectives. The focus is on holistic, sustainable, and human-centered value creation. Thus, the complexity of digitalization is increasing with the implementation of direct collaboration between humans and machines. In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are faced with major challenges as they have limited resources for implementing a successful digitalization strategy. This makes the use of maturity models (MMs) a valuable tool for shaping the strategically aligned digitalization transition of companies. In this context, this paper reviews whether the currently existing MMs for Industry 4.0 address the specific requirements of Industry 5.0, and sufficiently consider a human-centered approach along with the assessment of readiness for disruptive technologies in companies (especially SMEs). The study examines currently existing Industry 4.0 MMs as a part of a systematic literature review. A total of 297 German- and English-language publications were found and systematically investigated, of which 24 MMs provided sufficient scientific information in the end. These were categorized using a self-developed evaluation matrix. Furthermore, they were evaluated and discussed regarding their human-centered approach and applicability to SMEs. Through the analysis, key characteristics for Industry 4.0 MMs were identified, which can serve as a basis for the development of an Industry 5.0 assessment for SMEs.

Título: Measuring power consumption in mobile devices for energy sustainable app development: A comparative study and challenges
Resumo: Mobile device usage is increasing in daily life and almost everybody carries one. The devices now have more processing power, battery, memory, and a big display. However, they have limited battery lives. Software developers should focus on optimizing applications and systems by using resources and sensors efficiently to reduce their energy consumption. Developers lack the knowledge to enhance the energy efficiency of applications as they are not aware of their energy demands during development. To calculate the power consumption of a system, various third-party power measurement tools are on the market. The selection of an appropriate tool is challenging. The developers must know the power consumption of their application to create and optimize a sustainable product. In this paper, we review a wide range of power measuring tools for mobile devices. We will provide a short introduction to these tools, how they are implemented, and compare their capabilities and performance. We will detail the accuracy, usability, limitations, and challenges of using these tools.

Título: Meta-Requirements for Information System Requirements: Lesson Learned from Software Ecosystem Researches
Resumo: An information system should be specified so that the world containing the system meets the needs of people, who is interested in the world. Such needs are called requirements in problem frames. Concrete requirements have great diversity because each people focuses on different activities in the different worlds. However, we believe all requirements follow some laws when the requirements are proper. We call such laws as meta-requirements. We discuss and enumerate such meta-requirements in this paper so that we can judge some requirements are proper or not. Currently, we have four meta-requirements. First meta-requirement is the decrease of human effort. This is the most traditional and fundamental requirement when an artificial elements such as information systems are embedded in a world. Second one is the increase of human gain, which is dual of the first one. The rest meta-requirements come from researches of software ecosystem. Third meta-requirement is sustainability of the world. Fourth one is the increase of human participation in the world. We have already has our own requirements modeling notation called GDMA. However, we cannot examine requirements written in GDMA against all four meta-requirements. We thus extend our GDMA so that we can examine them against all the meta-requirements. We then exemplify some concrete requirements meet our four meta-requirements.

Título: Model simplification in manufacturing simulation – Review and framework
Resumo: Simulation models are meant to support industrial engineers in understanding complex problems and provide useful insights facilitating their solution. Models achieve this by reducing focus to system elements that matter. Surprisingly, despite its relevance, simulation model simplification is still very much a green field. This is mirrored in existing literature and course materials. In this article we seek to foster development of the field by proposing a framework for simulation model simplification addressing the manufacturing domain, thereby building on an extensive literature review. The framework structures the field by providing a unifying view on simulation model simplification, in terms of its key activities, i.e., reducing and preventing model complexity, and support offered in performing these. Apart from its role as a focal point for future research, the framework is meant to benefit practitioners and educators, by giving them access to research findings, and enabling and legitimatizing development of educational materials and their uptake.

Título: Multi-level Federated Learning for Industry 4.0 - A Crowdsourcing Approach
Resumo: Federated learning is one of the emerging areas of research in computer science. It has shown great potential in some application areas and we are witnessing evidence of new approaches where millions or even billions of IoT devices can contribute collectively to achieve a common goal of machine learning through federation. However, existing approaches are primarily suitable for single-task learning with a single objective in a single task owner where it is assumed that the majority of devices contributing to federated learning have a similar design or device type and restrictions. We argue that the true potential of federated learning can only be realised if we have a dynamic and open ecosystem where devices, industrial units, machine manufacturers, non-governmental agencies, and governmental entities can contribute toward learning for multiple tasks and objectives in a crowdsourced manner. In this article, we propose a multi-level framework that shows how federated learning, IoT, and crowdsourcing can come hand-in-hand with each other to make a robust ecosystem of multi-level federated learning for Industry 4.0. This helps build future intelligent applications for Industry 4.0 such as predictive maintenance and fault detection for systems in smart manufacturing units. In addition, we also highlight several use-cases of multi-level federated learning where this approach can be implemented in Industry 4.0. Moreover, if the approach is implemented successfully, besides enhancement in performance it will also help towards a greater common goal e.g. UN Sustainable Goal No 13 i.e. reduction in carbon footprint.

Título: Next-generation big data federation access control: A reference model
Resumo: This paper discusses one of the most significant challenges of next-generation big data (BD) federation platforms, namely, Hadoop access control. Privacy and security on a federation scale remain significant concerns among practitioners in both industry and academia. Hadoop’s current primitive access control presents security concerns and limitations, such as the complexity of deployment and the consumption of resources. However, this major concern has not been a subject of intensive study in the literature. This paper critically reviews and investigates these security limitations and provides a framework called BD federation access broker to address 8 main security limitations. This paper proposes the federated access control reference model (FACRM) to formalize the design of secure BD solutions within the Apache Hadoop stack. Furthermore, this paper discusses the implementation of the access broker and its usefulness for security breach detection and digital forensics investigations. The efficiency of the proposed access broker has not sustainably affected the performance overhead. The experimental results show only 1% of each 100 MB read/write operation in a WebHDFS. Overall, the findings of the paper pave the way for a wide range of revolutionary and state-of-the-art enhancements and future trends within Hadoop stack security and privacy.

Título: Optimizing Recycling Management Using Industrial Internet Supporting Circular Economy: A Case Study of an Emerging IPS2
Resumo: The paper concerns a case study about optimizing recycling management in terms of emptying containers holding, for instance, glass, paper, plastics or metal waste collected, thus supporting sustainability of natural resources and the circular economy. The case has been followed from the very start all the way to the current transformation into an IPS2 sold on a subscription basis. The main results of the case study suggest that the provider side must change considerably in terms of the business and organizational set-up, which has been challenging compared to the necessary, though more easily implemented, technological changes. Further, the IPS2 customers foresee improved efficiency and a decrease in unnecessary work if containers are emptied on time. In addition, the core of the IPS2 seems generalizable and transferable to other applications where collection and analysis of data are needed to support decision-making.

Título: Pathways to digital business models: The connection of sensing and seizing in business model innovation
Resumo: Digital business model innovation (BMI) is critical to achieving and sustaining competitiveness in technology-driven environments. In those environments, firms must not only sense changes to identify opportunities but also effectively seize them in BMI. Therefore, sensing and seizing cannot be considered as isolated dynamic capabilities, but must be combined for successful BMI. However, research on sensing and seizing does not offer compelling suggestions for firms that struggle with connecting both while pursuing digital BMI. We use qualitative configurational analysis (QCA) to analyze a sample of 49 case studies on digital BMI to identify the antecedents that firms sense before seizing these changes with digital BMI. Based on ten configurations of sensing (represented by six antecedents) and seizing (represented by four BMI types), we explain the relationship between sensed antecedents and seized digital BMI. In addition, we derived four variables that explain “what” and “how” firms connect sensing and seizing. Based on the sensing-seizing connection, we introduce consolidating BMI as a new type of BMI unique to the digital context. This novel type enables firms to exploit and explore new BMs and subsequent digital BMIs through the means of digital infrastructure. This study extends the understanding of how different business models emerge and how firms create digital BMIs.

Título: Patients' experience of an ecological momentary intervention involving self-monitoring and personalized feedback for depression
Resumo: Experts in clinical mental health research count on personalized approaches based on self-monitoring and self-management to improve treatment efficacy in psychiatry. Among other things, researchers expect that Ecological Momentary Interventions (EMI) based on self-monitoring and personalized feedback will reduce depressive symptoms. Clinical trial findings have, however, been conflicting. A recent trial (ZELF-i) investigated whether depression treatment might be enhanced by an add-on EMI with self-monitoring items and feedback focused on positive affect and activities (Do-module) or on negative affect and thinking patterns (Think-module). There was no statistical evidence that this EMI impacted clinical or functional outcomes beyond the effects of regular care, regardless of module content. In apparent contrast, 86% of the participants who completed the intervention indicated they would recommend it to others. In the present study, we used in-depth interviews (n = 20) to better understand the EMI's personal and clinical benefits and downsides. A thematic analysis of the interviews generated six areas of impact with various subthemes. In line with the trial results, few participants reported behavioral changes or symptom improvement over time; the self-assessments mainly amplified momentary mood, in either direction. The most often mentioned benefits were an increase in self-awareness, insight, and self-management (e.g., a stronger sense of control over complaints). Consistently, these domains received the highest ratings in our evaluation questionnaire (n = 89). Furthermore, the EMI instilled a routine into the days of individuals without regular jobs or other activities. Participants reported few downsides. The experiences were rather similar between the two modules. This study suggests that EMI might contribute to health by helping individuals deal with their symptoms, rather than reducing them. Measures on self-awareness, insight, and self-management should be more emphatically involved in future EMI research.

Título: Pay-as-you-go liquefied petroleum gas supports sustainable clean cooking in Kenyan informal urban settlement during COVID-19 lockdown
Resumo: Approximately 2.8 billion people rely on polluting fuels (e.g. wood, kerosene) for cooking. With affordability being a key access barrier to clean cooking fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), pay-as-you-go (PAYG) LPG smart meter technology may help resource-poor households adopt LPG by allowing incremental fuel payments. To understand the potential for PAYG LPG to facilitate clean cooking, objective evaluations of customers’ cooking and spending patterns are needed. This study uses novel smart meter data collected between January 2018-June 2020, spanning COVID-19 lockdown, from 426 PAYG LPG customers living in an informal settlement in Nairobi, Kenya to evaluate stove usage (e.g. cooking events/day, cooking event length). Seven semi-structured interviews were conducted in August 2020 to provide context for potential changes in cooking behaviours during lockdown. Using stove monitoring data, objective comparisons of cooking patterns are made with households using purchased 6 kg cylinder LPG in peri-urban Eldoret, Kenya. In Nairobi, 95% of study households continued using PAYG LPG during COVID-19 lockdown, with consumption increasing from 0.97 to 1.22 kg/capita/month. Daily cooking event frequency also increased by 60% (1.07 to 1.72 events/day). In contrast, average days/month using LPG declined by 75% during lockdown (17 to four days) among seven households purchasing 6 kg cylinder LPG in Eldoret. Interviewed customers reported benefits of PAYG LPG beyond fuel affordability, including safety, time savings and cylinder delivery. In the first study assessing PAYG LPG cooking patterns, LPG use was sustained despite a COVID-19 lockdown, illustrating how PAYG smart meter technology may help foster clean cooking access.

Título: Perspectives on risks and standards that affect the requirements engineering of blockchain technology
Resumo: Blockchain aims to transform businesses and other forms of transactions from a centralized, human-based to a shared, algorithm-based trust model, which enables a new risk management paradigm. Misaligned incentives in different principal – agent scenarios are important risk factors from governance point of view. With blockchain, these misalignments are accounted for algorithmically, therefore novel governance models are possible. What role do risks play in terms of deciding for, or against the adoption of blockchain? How to best define requirements to achieve it? This paper explores standards and risk as factors, which can support or hinder the sustained application of blockchain in a broad scope of environments. We conducted a systematic literature review that outlines a current understanding of perceived risk surrounding the adoption and use of blockchain technology in the context of requirements engineering. Furthermore, selected models for managing risks are presented. Finally, areas where deeper research is required are identified. We conclude that a gap exists in normative frameworks that affect the adoption and sustainable use of blockchain technology. Closing this gap can support the sustainable use of blockchain technology.

Título: Potentials and obstacles of the use of data mining in problem-solving processes
Resumo: Systematic problem-solving is an important component of sustainable and continuous improvement in production. Recent developments such as decreasing product lifecycles on the one hand and increasing product individualization and globalization on the other hand, impose new challenges to production systems. Due to the rising complexity, the analysis of a problem with conventional methods is becoming more and more difficult. One way to overcome these obstacles is to use the vast amount of data that is being gathered in manufacturing processes. Through data-based methods, product quality as well as the quality of decisions can be improved by revealing correlations and potentially underlying causalities that would have otherwise remained hidden to the observer. Previous research has revealed the need to investigate use cases of data-based support in systematic problem-solving processes. The goal of this publication is to review such use cases and to analyze the potentials and obstacles for their application. For this purpose, a systematic literature review was conducted. The relevant publications were analyzed in regards of the data-based methods used as well as the objectives pursued. Moreover, an overview of their application in each individual step of the problem-solving process is given in this paper.

Título: Predictive maintenance using digital twins: A systematic literature review
Resumo: Context: Predictive maintenance is a technique for creating a more sustainable, safe, and profitable industry. One of the key challenges for creating predictive maintenance systems is the lack of failure data, as the machine is frequently repaired before failure. Digital Twins provide a real-time representation of the physical machine and generate data, such as asset degradation, which the predictive maintenance algorithm can use. Since 2018, scientific literature on the utilization of Digital Twins for predictive maintenance has accelerated, indicating the need for a thorough review. Objective: This research aims to gather and synthesize the studies that focus on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins to pave the way for further research. Method: A systematic literature review (SLR) using an active learning tool is conducted on published primary studies on predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, in which 42 primary studies have been analyzed. Results: This SLR identifies several aspects of predictive maintenance using Digital Twins, including the objectives, application domains, Digital Twin platforms, Digital Twin representation types, approaches, abstraction levels, design patterns, communication protocols, twinning parameters, and challenges and solution directions. These results contribute to a Software Engineering approach for developing predictive maintenance using Digital Twins in academics and the industry. Conclusion: This study is the first SLR in predictive maintenance using Digital Twins. We answer key questions for designing a successful predictive maintenance model leveraging Digital Twins. We found that to this day, computational burden, data variety, and complexity of models, assets, or components are the key challenges in designing these models. © 2022

Título: Privacy Enhancing Technologies implementation: An investigation of its impact on work processes and employee perception
Resumo: With increasing consumer awareness towards information privacy and government-enforced regulations on data protection, organizations are implementing Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to provide systematic protection on consumers’ personal data. Current PETs literature focused mostly on the design and implementation of the technology without touching on its impact. Implementation literature has also examined the effects of various technologies on changes in work processes and employee perception but has yet to explore that of PETs. Therefore, the objective of this study is to understand the effects of PETs implementation on employees’ work processes as well as their perception towards the implementation. In-depth interview data was collected from three groups of affected employees belonging to one large mobile telecommunications company. Results show that PETs affected workload, communication level and data access, which led to different levels of changes depending on the nature of the work. The employees perceived PETs as useful. However, they perceived the company as not being properly prepared for the implementation, and also raised concerns on vendor accountability and the sustainability of the PETs. Our findings have implications for organizations planning to implement PETs.

Título: Publication trends in gamification: A systematic mapping study
Resumo: The term gamification and gamified systems are a trending area of research. However, gamification can indicate several different things, such as applying the game-like elements into the design of the user interface of a software, but not all gamification is necessarily associated with software products. Overall, it is unclear what different aspects are studied under the umbrella of ‘gamification’, and what is the current state of the art in the gamification research. In this paper, 1164 gamification studies are analyzed and classified based on their focus areas and the research topics to establish what the research trends in gamification are. Based on the results, e-learning and proof-of-concept studies in the ecological lifestyle and sustainability, assisting computer science studies and improving motivation are the trendiest areas of gamification research. Currently, the most common types of research are the proof-of-concept studies, and theoretical works on the different concepts and elements of gamification.

Título: Qualitative Analyses of Semantic Interoperability Approaches: Toward Learning based model transformations
Resumo: The emergence of cyber-physical systems and connected objects is helping to increase the technical complexity that enables the integration and the collaboration of information systems. This highly heterogeneous digital environment, subject to constant change, requires both the improvement of companies’ capacity for change and the rapid and effective expansion of their digital organization in a flexible and agile manner. In a rapidly changing industrial context, ensuring, and maintaining the digital continuity of information at all levels of the company becomes a major challenge from an economic, technical, and organizational perspective. To meet Industry 4.0 requirements for agility, flexibility, and responsiveness, a "plug- and-play" approach that breaks away from fixed norms and standards seems to be the solution to promote sustainable and on demand interoperability of systems. In this paper, the specifications of the “plug-and-play” are presented. Thus, a qualitative comparison is made between the ontology approach and the Model-Driven-Engineering approach. The goal is to compare their ability to ensure semantic interoperability of systems, and thus digital continuity, based on the criteria of genericity, dynamism, connectivity, integration, and federation capability.

Título: Reduction in greenhouse gas and other emissions from ship engines: Current trends and future options
Resumo: The impact of ship emission reductions can be maximised by considering climate, health and environmental effects simultaneously and using solutions fitting into existing marine engines and infrastructure. Several options available enable selecting optimum solutions for different ships, routes and regions. Carbon-neutral fuels, including low-carbon and carbon-negative fuels, from biogenic or non-biogenic origin (biomass, waste, renewable hydrogen) could resemble current marine fuels (diesel-type, methane and methanol). The carbon-neutrality of fuels depends on their Well-to-Wake (WtW) emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide emissions (N2O). Additionally, non-gaseous black carbon (BC) emissions have high global warming potential (GWP). Exhaust emissions which are harmful to health or the environment need to be equally removed using emission control achieved by fuel, engine or exhaust aftertreatment technologies. Harmful emission species include nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx), ammonia (NH3), formaldehyde, particle mass (PM) and number emissions (PN). Particles may carry polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals, which cause serious adverse health issues. Carbon-neutral fuels are typically sulphur-free enabling negligible SOx emissions and efficient exhaust aftertreatment technologies, such as particle filtration. The combinations of carbon-neutral drop-in fuels and efficient emission control technologies would enable (near-)zero-emission shipping and these could be adaptable in the short- to mid-term. Substantial savings in external costs on society caused by ship emissions give arguments for regulations, policies and investments needed to support this development.

Título: Reference architectures for smart manufacturing: A critical review
Resumo: The demand for more personalized, smart, and sustainable products and the rapid growth of the industrial Internet and cyber-physical technologies have led to the development of several new paradigms for manufacturing in recent years. Examples include smart manufacturing, cyber-physical production systems, Industry 4.0, cloud manufacturing, and social manufacturing. This article questions the necessity of this ‘multiplicity’ of definitions and takes a systematic approach to portraying a consistent ‘blueprint’ (i.e., a reference architecture) that rationalizes and encompasses all of these different viewpoints and proposals. Through conceptual analysis of these new paradigms and several emerging reference architectures such as RAMI4.0, IIRA, IBM Industry 4.0, and NIST Smart Manufacturing, service-orientation was identified as the main theme: digitalization and integration of manufacturing resources on the IoT as on-demand services, as the main enabler of value network integration and collaboration as well as smart plug-and-produce shop-floor systems. The hypothesis was recast in terms of six propositions on the characteristics of smart manufacturing and evaluated through interviews with seven experts from industry, government, and standards organizations. The general hypothesis was accepted, and several recommendations were provided to address the identified design and implementation barriers. In conclusion, two high-priority actionable plans were identified: (1) modeling and composition of micro-services, and (2) optimizing the topology of interactions between micro-services, smart objects, and humans.

Título: Research opportunities in PSS design focusing on the potentials of agile approaches
Resumo: Product-Service Systems (PSS) are offerings combining product, service and, in some cases, internet-of-things (IoT) functionalities to a uniform value proposition (e.g. car sharing), which promises higher customer value, greater sustainability, constant revenue streams and other benefits. The development of PSS, however, adds extra complexity to development processes compared to stand-alone products. While a lot of research exists in the field of PSS development processes, application in industry is still low. One possible explanation for that is that the plan-driven logic behind process models, which differs from the trends regarding agility and new iterative management models. Hence, as a result it needs to be clarified if agile approaches can benefit PSS design models? Fourteen researchers in the domains of PSS development and process model design from the University of São Paulo and Technical University of Berlin met in two workshop sessions, lasting for four days each, in order to explore barriers for industry application of PSS development theory and to identify research opportunities regarding agile approaches for more practical PSS design models. The research team has conducted multiple sessions using different methods such as world café, concept map, cause-effect diagram, in order to identify research questions. Industry experts, who attended the workshop, as well as visits to PSS providers in Germany and Brazil, have been used to verify our findings assuring practical relevance. This paper presents a list of research opportunities identified that consolidate an initial research agenda. We found that it is necessary to explore the potentials of agile approaches in PSS design to better synchronize development cycles, to incorporate different stakeholders and their interfaces and to adapt development plans to dynamic environments. These research routes can be a solution for practical, flexible and simple PSS design models.

Título: Reusing Equipment in Cells Reconfiguration for a Lean and Sustainable Production
Resumo: Production cells are considered a flexible production system capable to face new market demands. In most cases, this is provided by their capability of reconfiguration, i.e., by removing/adding new equipment needed and/or reusing the existent equipment for the new demand. Nevertheless, some companies are not conveniently exploring this opportunity. What happened, many times, is the design of a complete new cell replacing all the equipment and sending the existent machinery to the warehouse. This is a decision that, economically and environmentally, is costly. Furthermore, knowing that some equipment could be reused for a new product. In a Lean Thinking, this is waste and a Lean company should promote a more efficient and sustainable production. This paper introduces a study in a Lean company that has developed practices to reuse equipment. The reasons for the non-reuse of the existent equipment were studied and some strategies were proposed to turn this equipment available and visible for reuse. Also, the benefits of reusing equipment related with saved costs and contribution to the environmental sustainability, are discussed.

Título: Sector diversity in Green Information Technology practices: Technology Acceptance Model perspective
Resumo: This paper examines the existence of diversity between public-and private-sector establishments in Green Information Technology (GIT) adoption using the ‘Technology Acceptance Model’ (TAM). In this study, GIT simply refers to using IT in ways that help to reduce environmental impacts, which include using energy more efficiently and reducing waste. The model is extended to include the external variables as subjective norm and the level of GIT awareness. For this purpose, a survey was conducted among professionals from public- and private-sector establishments. The findings suggest the following: (1) Diversity exists among establishments from public- and private-sectors in the influence of the Perceived Ease-of-Use (PEU) on Perceived Usefulness (PU) and on the Attitude Towards Use (ATU); (2) Most of the public-sector professionals have concerns for environmental sustainability in using IT; (3) TAM is an important tool for investigating the specific barriers and facilitators of environmental behavior at work; (4) TAM has a have significant predictive power in public -sector establishments; and (5) TAM is significant for private-sector establishments except the relations between the PEU and PU, and PEU and ATU.

Título: Seeking rhetorical validity in fear appeal research: An application of rhetorical theory
Resumo: A significant focus of behavioral security research has been on understanding employees’ motives for protecting sensitive assets. To date, theorizing efforts in this space have focused on appraisal processes and nomological models that are designed to capture the responses to the security threats articulated within fear appeals. Because fear appeals are persuasive messages used to generate a sense of urgency about a specific threat that influences protective information security behaviors, they are an important focus in behavioral security research. However, we suggest that theoretical guidance is needed to facilitate further research in this area. We argue that ultimately, fear appeals are treatments intended to serve as catalysts of behavioral change. Therefore, fear appeals should have rhetorical validity, which is a specialized form of ecological validity in which contextualization has been included to ensure that the language embedded in the stimulus is consistent with the threat environment and the expectations of its audience. The rhetorical validity of a fear appeal should account for its exigence, the audience, and any constraints that shape the presentation and reception of the discourse. Using the illustrative example of a well-known behavioral security theory, protection motivation theory, this study provides a framework for behavioral security scholars in designing fear appeals that have rhetorical validity.

Título: Self-adaptive systems: A systematic literature review across categories and domains
Resumo: Context: Championed by IBM’s vision of autonomic computing paper in 2003, the autonomic computing research field has seen increased research activity over the last 20 years. Several conferences (SEAMS, SASO, ICAC) and workshops (SISSY) have been established and have contributed to the autonomic computing knowledge base in search of a new kind of system — a self-adaptive system (SAS). These systems are characterized by being context-aware and can act on that awareness. The actions carried out could be on the system or on the context (or environment). The underlying goal of a SAS is the sustained achievement of its goals despite changes in its environment. Objective: Despite a number of literature reviews on specific aspects of SASs ranging from their requirements to quality attributes, we lack a systematic understanding of the current state of the art. Method: This paper contributes a systematic literature review into self-adaptive systems using the dblp computer science bibliography as a database. We filtered the records systematically in successive steps to arrive at 293 relevant papers. Each paper was critically analyzed and categorized into an attribute matrix. This matrix consisted of five categories, with each category having multiple attributes. The attributes of each paper, along with the summary of its contents formed the basis of the literature review that spanned 30 years (1990–2020). Results: We characterize the maturation process of the research area from theoretical papers over practical implementations to more holistic and generic approaches, frameworks, and exemplars, applied to areas such as networking, web services, and robotics, with much of the recent work focusing on IoT and IaaS. Conclusion: While there is an ebb and flow of application domains, domains like bio-inspired approaches, security, and cyber–physical systems showed promise to grow heading into the 2020s.

Título: Smart tourism in Villages: Challenges and the Alpujarra Case Study
Resumo: Cities are making significant efforts to implement the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, in which sensors collect data from heterogeneous sources, and advanced software systems can provide an accurate city context. Most initiatives focus on improving the quality of life through energy-efficient buildings, waste management, or reducing traffic congestion. One of the main applications of IoT is smart tourism. This concept focuses on using Information and Communication Technologies to give visitors better experiences without interfering with the city's daily life. This paper studies related concepts and related works in smart tourism, sustainability, and IoT, identifying challenges and literature gaps. Finally, we provide a brief analysis of the real case study of the mountainous Alpujarra region in Spain based on its specific characteristics.

Título: Social sustainability indicators: A comprehensive review with application in the energy sector
Resumo: Sustainability is achieved by fulfilling economic, environmental, and social goals. Until recently, social sustainability indicators had not received much attention in the literature. Social sustainability and its indicators are poorly understood, which makes it somewhat difficult to oversee the design and implementation of sustainability projects. This paper responds to this by investigating Social Sustainability Indicators (SSIs) across many sectors to learn how they could potentially apply to the energy sector, with special attention given to classifying those indicators into energy supply chains (ESCs), stakeholder, and impact levels. It does this by critical reviewing 420 social indicators in the literature and proposing a practical set of categories related to the energy sector. The findings show that the majority of SSIs address the “production” and “demand” stages of ESC. SSIs related to employees are also common, based on stakeholder analysis. The analysis highlighted the importance of internal stakeholders, in particular, in achieving social sustainability. The number of SSIs at the strategic level far exceeds those at the tactical and operational levels. There is no consensus on definitions of SSIs, and, subsequently, there is no agreement on their measurement or the data needed for that purpose. Potential SSIs that may conflict with one another are investigated to identify implementation challenges. The contribution of this paper is classifying the SSIs, identifying the gaps, investigating implementation challenges, discussing implications, and proposing future research directions to promote awareness about renewable energy for better progress towards sustainability.

Título: Socio-technical scales in socio-environmental modeling: Managing a system-of-systems modeling approach
Resumo: System-of-systems approaches for integrated assessments have become prevalent in recent years. Such approaches integrate a variety of models from different disciplines and modeling paradigms to represent a socio-environmental (or social-ecological) system aiming to holistically inform policy and decision-making processes. Central to the system-of-systems approaches is the representation of systems in a multi-tier framework with nested scales. Current modeling paradigms, however, have disciplinary-specific lineage, leading to inconsistencies in the conceptualization and integration of socio-environmental systems. In this paper, a multidisciplinary team of researchers, from engineering, natural and social sciences, have come together to detail socio-technical practices and challenges that arise in the consideration of scale throughout the socio-environmental modeling process. We identify key paths forward, focused on explicit consideration of scale and uncertainty, strengthening interdisciplinary communication, and improvement of the documentation process. We call for a grand vision (and commensurate funding) for holistic system-of-systems research that engages researchers, stakeholders, and policy makers in a multi-tiered process for the co-creation of knowledge and solutions to major socio-environmental problems.

Título: Software component decision-making: In-house, OSS, COTS or outsourcing - A systematic literature review
Resumo: Context: Component-based software systems require decisions on component origins for acquiring components. A component origin is an alternative of where to get a component from. Objective: To identify factors that could influence the decision to choose among different component origins and solutions for decision-making (For example, optimization) in the literature. Method: A systematic review study of peer-reviewed literature has been conducted. Results: In total we included 24 primary studies. The component origins compared were mainly focused on in-house vs. COTS and COTS vs. OSS. We identified 11 factors affecting or influencing the decision to select a component origin. When component origins were compared, there was little evidence on the relative (either positive or negative) effect of a component origin on the factor. Most of the solutions were proposed for in-house vs. COTS selection and time, cost and reliability were the most considered factors in the solutions. Optimization models were the most commonly proposed technique used in the solutions. Conclusion: The topic of choosing component origins is a green field for research, and in great need of empirical comparisons between the component origins, as well of how to decide between different combinations of them. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Título: Spot pricing in the Cloud ecosystem: A comparative investigation
Resumo: Background: Spot pricing is considered as a significant supplement for building a full-fledged market economy for the Cloud ecosystem. However, it seems that both providers and consumers are still hesitating to enter the Cloud spot market. The relevant academic community also has conflicting opinions about Cloud spot pricing in terms of revenue generation. Aim: This work aims to systematically identify, assess, synthesize and report the published evidence in favor of or against spot-price scheme compared with fixed-price scheme of Cloud computing, so as to help relieve the aforementioned conflict. Method: We employed the systematic literature review (SLR) method to collect and investigate the empirical studies of Cloud spot pricing indexed by major electronic libraries. Results: This SLR identified 61 primary studies that either delivered discussions or conducted experiments to perform comparison between spot pricing and fixed pricing in the Cloud domain. The reported benefits and limitations were summarized to facilitate cost-benefit analysis of being a Cloud spot pricing player, while four types of theories were distinguished to help both researchers and practitioners better understand the Cloud spot market. Conclusions: This SLR shows that the academic community strongly advocates the emerging Cloud spot market. Although there is still a lack of practical and easily deployable market-driven mechanisms, the overall findings of our work indicate that spot pricing plays a promising role in the sustainability of Cloud resource exploitation.

Título: Successful extreme programming: Fidelity to the methodology or good teamworking?
Resumo: Context Developing a theory of agile technology, in combination with empirical work, must include assessing its performance effects, and whether all or some of its key ingredients account for any performance advantage over traditional methods. Given the focus on teamwork, is the agile technology what really matters, or do general team factors, such as cohesion, primarily account for a team’s success? Perhaps the more specific software engineering team factors, for example the agile development method’s collective ownership and code management, are decisive. Objective To assess the contribution of agile methodology, agile-specific team methods, and general team factors in the performance of software teams. Method We studied 40 small-scale software development teams which used Extreme Programming (XP). We measured (1) the teams’ adherence to XP methods, (2) their use of XP-specific team practices, and (3) standard team attributes, as well as the quality of the project’s outcomes. We used Williams et al.’s (2004a) [33] Shodan measures of XP methods, and regression analysis. Results All three types of variables are associated with the project’s performance. Teamworking is important but it is the XP-specific team factor (continuous integration, coding standards, and collective code ownership) that is significant. Only customer planning (release planning/planning game, customer access, short releases, and stand-up meeting) is positively related to performance. A negative relationship between foundations (automated unit tests, customer acceptance tests, test-first design, pair programming, and refactoring) is found and is moderated by craftsmanship (sustainable pace, simple design, and metaphor/system of names). Of the general team factors only cooperation is related to performance. Cooperation mediates the relationship between the XP-specific team factor and performance. Conclusion Client and team foci of the XP method are its critical active ingredients.

Título: Sustainability analysis and ease of learning in artifact-based requirements engineering: The newest member of the family of studies (It’s a girl!)
Resumo: Context: Artifact-based requirements engineering promises to deliver results of high quality while allowing for flexibility in the development process and the project settings. Tailored for analyzing sustainability, it can offer tangible insights on potential benefits and risks of a system under development. However, as of now there is still relatively little empirical evidence available that would prove this quality, flexibility, and insight potential. Previous studies, specifically on the first two characteristics, differ in their socio-economic contexts and make the findings hard to generalize. Objective: Our goal is to investigate the advantages and limitations in the application of artifact-based requirements engineering by new, inexperienced requirements engineers to extend our family of studies. In addition, the secondary goal is to evaluate the suitability of the sustainability analysis artifact for a sustainability analysis of the system planned for development. Method: We report on a new member in a family of studies with 20 participants for evaluating artifact models in a sustainability application context. We use a graduate block course as case. Our data collection is performed via survey at the end of the course, based on the same instrument used in previous studies, and extended with a new section on evaluating the suitability of a particular artifact for sustainability analysis. Results: Both from the quantitative and the qualitative feedback, the results indicate that the students have benefitted from the artifact-based approach to analyzing sustainability in requirements engineering. Usability, syntactic and semantic quality were all rated high and the rationales were positive, as was the feedback on the sustainability analysis artifact. Conclusion: The results contribute to a reliable database on artifact-oriented requirements engineering and strengthen our confidence in the general benefits of artifact-orientation. Relating the old and new data provides some more insight into the trajectory of the wider transfer of artifact-based requirements engineering into practice.

Título: Sustainability Digital Twin: a tool for the manufacturing industry
Resumo: The use of Digital Twins in the manufacturing industry has significantly increased in the past years, given its potential to contribute to solutions for the current environmental and digitalization challenges. To address the needs of the industry and achieve a higher level of sustainability a robust tool, such as a Digital Twin, must be used because the physical processes are highly complex, with constantly changing variables. On the other hand, current goals of the manufacturing sector, such as circular economy and zero-emissions, require data sharing in the supply chain. This paper presents the development of a framework for the assessment of energy efficiency and sustainability of production processes, with respect to the measured consumption of the different resources. In addition, a concept for privacy preserving data sharing within the manufacturing supply chain is presented. Two real case studies from the big component production industry located in northern Germany are discussed in this paper. As result, the framework is presented and the case study successfully identifies significant energy efficiency and sustainability optimization possibilities, achieved with very simple modeling.

Título: Sustainability in Model-based Planning and Control of Global Value Creation Networks
Resumo: Manufacturing companies are affected by an increasing complexity driven thru fast changing requirements in the global market. To meet the large catalogue of requirements, enterprises are forming global value creation networks and provide services jointly. The existing time pressure and the involvement of many stakeholders results in a demand of methods and tools for a quick configuration of such networks. Beside the management of material, information and money flows the quest of a sustainable corporate development poses a further challenge for the decision makers. The consideration of sustainability in business process management is one approach to take also social, economic and environmental aspects within global value creation networks into account. Reviewing existing modelling techniques shows that the requirements for a fast configuration and an adequate management of sustainability are just insufficiently addressed or are raising the complexity further. This paper will explore capabilities of an enterprise modelling technique which supports an integrated handling of network configuration and sustainability management in a fast and efficient manner.

Título: Sustainability in the Information Society: A Proposal of Information Systems Requirements in View of the DPOBE Model for Organizational Sustainability
Resumo: The importance of information in the world and the so-called information society places information systems in the center of the organizations’ sustainability. There aren’t any owners of the economic information and there isn’t any real domain over the information systems, infrastructures and technologies and particularly over communications. These challenges display the relevance of all who assume the responsibility for management of information and technologies systems which can affect the normal functioning of the markets and economic organizations. Sustainability questions focus themselves on the articulation from several agents, on the management of information and technological resources and on the efficiency of markets, aiming to grant a peaceful and consolidated continuity of society. Beyond several factors which can be considered relevant to achieve organizational sustainability in the frame of information and knowledge society, there are some nuclear pillars in which managers and organizations need to develop competences. This theoretical approach, supported by a focus group research, aims to evaluate and propose a group of key elements to be measured for a proper evaluation of the organizations’ sustainability in the context of information society, taking in view future empirical studies and the application of the concept in management tasks.

Título: Sustainable Knowledge Sharing Model for IT Agile Projects
Resumo: In order to overcome work environment challenges and remain competitive in the market, organisations must adapt. An organisation's competitiveness can be improved through knowledge sharing; however, improvement without responsibility can have a negative impact on the sociotechnical environment which people cannot fully comprehend. According to researchers, business involvement in sustainable development goals remains minimal [51]. As a result, a sustainable consciousness is crucial to improve the business. In the project profession, sustainability is a business approach that balances the environmental, social, economic, and political aspects of project-based work to fulfil the demands of stakeholders without jeopardising or overburdening the availability of natural resources for future generations [33]. This study goes a step further and proposes a theoretical design that aims to ensure sustainable development during conceptual knowledge transfer in Agile IT projects.

Título: Sustaining and advancing IT careers: Women’s experiences in a UK-based IT company
Resumo: This article contributes to a growing literature on women in IT occupations. Against a national and international context of women’s longstanding and continued under-representation in senior professional roles in IT, our study at organizational level tells the story of women’s career experiences in a specific UK-based IT company in relation to its culture, processes and practices. Utilising a concept from the gender literature – Acker’s (2006) ‘inequality regimes’ – the study bridges the gap between the gender and IS literature and feminist theorising in order to shed light on the lack of gender diversity in IT. The article specifically shows how components of organizational inequality regimes, namely, ‘organizing processes’, ‘legitimacy’ and ‘visibility’ of inequalities combine and interact to produce and maintain gender inequality in the IT workplace. The implications of this in the sector more generally are discussed.

Título: Sustaining collaborative software development through strategic consortium
Resumo: In recent years, consortium-based open source software (COSS) development has emerged as a strategic alternative to resource-intensive in-house development and misaligned commercial software acquisition. Yet consortia undertaking such collaborative efforts struggle to balance the oft-competing demands of innovation and sustainability. Drawing upon a longitudinal case study of the Kuali initiative, this analysis examines the mechanisms of exploration and exploitation involved in developing and sustaining a COSS approach. Based on our findings in the Kuali case, we develop a conceptual framework to discern whether and how COSS development initiatives can achieve contextual ambidexterity, balancing the strategic goals of innovation and sustainability over time. While exploration- and exploitation-oriented efforts compete for resources, our analysis reveals that they may also complement one another across distinct layers of institutional activity. The contextual ambidexterity is achieved through multi-level collaboration enabled by a modular technical and organizational design.

Título: Systematic literature reviews in agile software development: A tertiary study
Resumo: Context A number of systematic literature reviews and mapping studies (SLRs) covering numerous primary research studies on various aspects of agile software development (ASD) exist. Objective The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the SLRs on ASD research topics for software engineering researchers and practitioners. Method We followed the tertiary study guidelines by Kitchenham et al. to find SLRs published between late 1990s to December 2015. Results We found 28 SLRs focusing on ten different ASD research areas: adoption, methods, practices, human and social aspects, CMMI, usability, global software engineering (GSE), organizational agility, embedded systems, and software product line engineering. The number of SLRs on ASD topics, similar to those on software engineering (SE) topics in general, is on the rise. A majority of the SLRs applied standardized guidelines and the quality of these SLRs on ASD topics was found to be slightly higher for journal publications than for conferences. While some individuals and institutions seem to lead this area, the spread of authors and institutions is wide. With respect to prior review recommendations, significant progress was noticed in the area of connecting agile to established domains such as usability, CMMI, and GSE; and considerable progress was observed in focusing on management-oriented approaches as Scrum and sustaining ASD in different contexts such as embedded systems. Conclusion SLRs of ASD studies are on the rise and cover a variety of ASD aspects, ranging from early adoption issues to newer applications of ASD such as in product line engineering. ASD research can benefit from further primary and secondary studies on evaluating benefits and challenges of ASD methods, agile hybrids in large-scale setups, sustainability, motivation, teamwork, and project management; as well as a fresh review of empirical studies in ASD to cover the period post 2008. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Título: Systems thinking and efficiency under emissions constraints: Addressing rebound effects in digital innovation and policy
Resumo: Summary Innovations and efficiencies in digital technology have lately been depicted as paramount in the green transition to enable the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, both in the information and communication technology (ICT) sector and the wider economy. This, however, fails to adequately account for rebound effects that can offset emission savings and, in the worst case, increase emissions. In this perspective, we draw on a transdisciplinary workshop with 19 experts from carbon accounting, digital sustainability research, ethics, sociology, public policy, and sustainable business to expose the challenges of addressing rebound effects in digital innovation processes and associated policy. We utilize a responsible innovation approach to uncover potential ways forward for incorporating rebound effects in these domains, concluding that addressing ICT-related rebound effects ultimately requires a shift from an ICT efficiency-centered perspective to a “systems thinking” model, which aims to understand efficiency as one solution among others that requires constraints on emissions for ICT environmental savings to be realized.

Título: Technological revolutions in smart farming: Current trends, challenges & future directions
Resumo: With increasing population, the demand for agricultural productivity is rising to meet the goal of “Zero Hunger”. Consequently, farmers have optimized the agricultural activities in a sustainable way with the modern technologies. This integration has boosted the agriculture production due to high potentiality in assisting the farmers. The impulse towards the technological advancement has revived the traditional agriculture methods and resulted in eco-friendly, sustainable, and efficient farming. This has revolutionized the era of smart farming which primarily alliance with modern technologies like, big data, machine learning, deep learning, swarm intelligence, internet-of-things, block chain, robotics and autonomous system, cloud-fog-edge computing, cyber physical systems, and generative adversarial networks (GAN). To cater the same, a detailed survey on ten hot-spots of smart farming is presented in this paper. The survey covers the technology-wise state-of-the-art methods along with their application domains. Moreover, the publicly available data sets with existing research challenges are investigated. Lastly, the paper concludes with suggestions to the identified problems and possible future research directions.

Título: The challenges that challenge: Engaging with agile practitioners’ concerns
Resumo: Context There continues to be concern that research is not addressing the challenges that practice faces. For the benefit of academia and industry, researchers need to be aware of practitioners’ challenges and their context so that relevant and applicable research is undertaken. Objective This paper investigates two research questions: what challenges do agile practitioners face? and, how do practitioner challenges manifest themselves in an organisational setting? It aims to map the practitioner challenge landscape, explore challenge characteristics, compare findings with previous literature and identify implications for research that is relevant to practice. Method A combination of methods was used: elicitation of practitioner challenges collected using a Challenge Wall at a series of practitioner events; organisational case study using interviews, document analysis and observation; and online survey. Findings were then compared to previous publications. Results Challenges collected from the Challenge Wall were grouped under 27 subthemes and seven themes: claims and limitations, organisation, sustainability, culture, teams, scale, and value. Investigating one challenge in the case study uncovered a set of new challenges, which were inter-related. Over 50% of survey respondents experienced challenges highlighted in the case study. Conclusion The landscape of agile practitioner challenges is complex and intertwined. Some challenges, such as doing agile in a non-agile environment, are multi-dimensional, affect many aspects of practice, and may be experienced simultaneously as business, organisational, social and adaptation problems. Some challenges, such as understanding cultural change or measuring agile value, persist and are hard to address, while others, such as adoption, change focus over time. Some challenges, such as governance and contracts, are under-researched, while others, such as business and IT transformation, have been researched but findings have not had the expected impact. Researchers wishing to address practitioner challenges need to treat them in context rather than in isolation and improve knowledge transfer.

Título: The evolution of ontology in AEC: A two-decade synthesis, application domains, and future directions
Resumo: Ontologies play a pivotal role in knowledge representation, particularly beneficial for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) sector due to its inherent data diversity and intricacy. Despite the growing interest in ontology and data integration research, especially with the advent of knowledge graphs and digital twins, a noticeable lack of consolidated academic synthesis still needs to be addressed. This review paper aims to bridge that gap, meticulously analysing 142 journal articles from 2000 to 2021 on the application of ontologies in the AEC sector. The research is segmented through systematic evaluation into ten application domains within the construction realm- process, cost, operation/maintenance, health/safety, sustainability, monitoring/control, intelligent cities, heritage building information modelling (HBIM), compliance, and miscellaneous. This categorisation aids in pinpointing ontologies suitable for various research objectives. Furthermore, the paper highlights prevalent limitations within current ontology studies in the AEC sector. It offers strategic recommendations, presenting a well-defined path for future research to address these gaps.

Título: The Extensible Orchestration Framework approach to collaborative design in architectural, urban and construction engineering
Resumo: The proliferation of information technologies and the diversity of problem domains that heavily rely on software tool applications promote computer-supported cooperative work as a challenging discipline that drives the development process of contemporary and future engineering methods, standards, and tools. Consequently, a particular domain of expertise in engineering and scientific fields has emerged, demanding more advanced skills and deeper domain knowledge. The essential role of Architectural Design (AD) and Urban Planning (UP) is to enable a forward-looking approach to building/facility creation. Construction Engineering (CE) expresses its routine primarily through a transition phase that transforms ideas to sustainable urban artifacts. The CE role appears as a combination of backward and downward looking to the same process/product. All three domains are highly cooperative in the context of Environmental Engineering (EE). Currently available software tools that support the AD, UP and CE domains are far from simple. Several recent software engineering studies suggest that, instead of developing a complex “all in one solution”, the federation or orchestration of several related simple methods and tools seems promising. In this article, we discuss the basic AD, UP and CE domain-cooperation aspects and suggest an Extensible Orchestration Framework (ExOF) model that may support them. To verify the ExOF simulation and orchestration potential, we used its architectural model to orchestrate different software tools when performing the urban blocks daylight illumination simulation for different urban block morphology models. For the exact simulation, we used the normalized sun-exposition data for the city of Novi Sad, Serbia. Also presented is an illustration of the methodology, modeling and orchestration potential of ExOF for the selected case study, together with the results, obtained for typical 3D models of selected urban block morphology patterns.

Título: The future of the technology-based manufacturing in the European Union
Resumo: The manufacturing industry tries to innovate always to cater to customer-oriented products. The digitization of manufacturing is revolutionizing the future of this industry. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is bringing down the labor cost, reducing the machine downtime, and overall increasing the production speed. A new technological trend like Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses computer algorithms based on available data and can improve or decide further, automatically, based on experience, without the need for prior programming commands. ML can improve daily processes for identifying bottlenecks, developing products, controlling quality, providing security to the industry, and using AI robotics in place of humans. On one hand, technologies like ML, AI, IIoT, new materials, photonics, and rapid prototyping are driving the manufacturing sector in adopting a future version of Industry 4.0, and on the other hand, the European Commission (EC) has defined a roadmap until 2050 or more, in achieving the sustainable goal of carbon-neutrality and complete digitalization with resilience across the European continent. However, it is challenging to match the planned and actual roadmaps to the future of the technology-based manufacturing industry. There are uncertainties about how the future will be shaped by technologies in the EU manufacturing industry, in the changing political, environmental and social world environment. Recognizing these difficulties, the current article consults the available literature on this topic to determine the factors that will characterize the future of the manufacturing industry across EU countries. The relevant information about the EU manufacturing sectors has first been collected from various sources like Eurostat data, the EC policy documents, manufacturing company's annual reports, research reviews, journal articles, EU Industry Days annual event, etc. Then the collected data were analyzed to gain insight into the future of the technology-based EU manufacturing industry in the context of the European Commission's outlined policies. Variable factors from different manufacturing sectors are presented from different EU member states and scenario analysis was used for understanding the possible future. It is concluded that the future does not lie in adapting to the changing environment but in creating the future by EU companies themselves - revolution must be met by revolution. Their early experiences and path dependency can be seen as stubbornness, which may act as formidable barriers to building new capabilities. Therefore, companies must step-wise integrate resources to create a new process, and new structure, with personnel motivation, that fits with the broader European context in the coming decades.

Título: The journey to technical excellence in agile software development
Resumo: Context: Technical excellence is a nebulous term in agile software development. This vagueness is risky because it may lead to misunderstandings and to agile implementations that may overlook a key principle of agile development. Objective: This study investigates how agile practitioners interpret the concept of technical excellence brought up in Principle 9 of the Agile manifesto. Moreover, we investigate how agile practitioners put the concept into practice and what conditions facilitate putting technical excellence into practice. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with twenty agile practitioners, coded the data inductively, and performed two sessions to validate the emerging findings. Results: We find that technical excellence is first and foremost a mindset that is underpinned by continuous attention to sustainable code, continuous learning, and teamwork. Fostering technical excellence requires the adoption of design and development practices, such as continuous architecting, and is supported by continuous learning. We also identify three enabling conditions for technical excellence: Leadership support, customer buy-in, and psychological safety. These enablers provide teams with leeway to nurture their pursuit of technical excellence. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the key role of people-based strategies in promoting technical excellence in agile software development. They show that the attainment of technical excellence does not only involve technical practices. On the contrary, it relies on social and organizational support and, most importantly, a mindset.

Título: The MESSAGEix Integrated Assessment Model and the ix modeling platform (ixmp): An open framework for integrated and cross-cutting analysis of energy, climate, the environment, and sustainable development
Resumo: The MESSAGE Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) developed by IIASA has been a central tool of energy-environment-economy systems analysis in the global scientific and policy arena. It played a major role in the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); it provided marker scenarios of the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) and the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs); and it underpinned the analysis of the Global Energy Assessment (GEA). Alas, to provide relevant analysis for current and future challenges, numerical models of human and earth systems need to support higher spatial and temporal resolution, facilitate integration of data sources and methodologies across disciplines, and become open and transparent regarding the underlying data, methods, and the scientific workflow. In this manuscript, we present the building blocks of a new framework for an integrated assessment modeling platform; the “ecosystem” comprises: i) an open-source GAMS implementation of the MESSAGE energy++ system model integrated with the MACRO economic model; ii) a Java/database back-end for version-controlled data management, iii) interfaces for the scientific programming languages Python & R for efficient input data and results processing workflows; and iv) a web-browser-based user interface for model/scenario management and intuitive “drag-and-drop” visualization of results. The framework aims to facilitate the highest level of openness for scientific analysis, bridging the need for transparency with efficient data processing and powerful numerical solvers. The platform is geared towards easy integration of data sources and models across disciplines, spatial scales and temporal disaggregation levels. All tools apply best-practice in collaborative software development, and comprehensive documentation of all building blocks and scripts is generated directly from the GAMS equations and the Java/Python/R source code.

Título: The Role of Leadership in Implementing Lean Manufacturing
Resumo: It is widely accepted that for the successful implementation of lean manufacturing, the senior management commitment is of great importance. However, the lean journey is usually a long one, and eventually management commitment creeps. Furthermore, the involvement of employees in daily improvements is also critical for the success of implementation. Lean leadership can be considered as a way of sustaining and improving the employee performance in lean production systems. In the present study, a thorough literature review is presented focusing in reviewing the principles of lean leadership and the practices that can lead in improving the employee performance. Furthermore, the characteristics and qualities of lean leader are discussed.

Título: The role of the Project Management Office in Sustainable Project Management
Resumo: The transition towards more sustainable business practices requires the changing of products, services, processes, policies and resources of organizations. Acknowledging the role projects play in these change, the concepts of sustainability should be integrated in the way projects are planned, organized, executed, managed and governed. This sustainability perspective evolved into the concept of Sustainable Project Management, which is considered one of the most important global project management trends today. Within organizations, the project management office plays a leading role in the standards, methods and practices of project management. However, the role of the PMO in sustainable project management is still unexplored. This paper explores how sustainable project management impacts the responsibilities and tasks of a PMO. Based on an analysis of relevant literature, a list of responsibilities and tasks of a project management office is developed. The study shows that a PMO can play an key-enabling role in the sustainability of projects and project management and thereby in the transition of organizations towards more sustainable business practices.

Título: Towards a taxonomy of technical debt for COTS-intensive cyber physical systems
Resumo: Most existing studies addressing COTS obsolescence issues in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) have strong emphasis on the sustainment phases. We have identified a gap on methods, processes, and tools for effective COTS risk analysis in the early systems acquisition phases. To fill the gap, this study proposes a taxonomy of COTS-related technical debt in order to support early identification, communication, and assessment of obsolescence risks in CPS system engineering life cycles. The taxonomy contributes to the identification of seven key types of COTS technical debt according to systematic signs discoverable during early COTS activities, which may contribute to obsolescence in later phases. These seven types of COTS technical debt include COTS functionality mismatch, performance mismatch, interoperability difficulty, versioning frequency, documentation and support readiness, and limitation on system evolution. It is expected that such notions will help to increase the efficiency of COTS-based CPS development, readiness, and sustainment, through more informed COTS decision-making to avoid expensive and unaffordable obsolescence issues in the envisioned systems sustainment phases.

Título: Understanding user participation in online communities: A systematic literature review of empirical studies
Resumo: Online communities have become a popular and widely studied research topic. As active participation has been acknowledged as essential for the sustainability of the communities, research has focused largely on the most visible participants with the greatest financial value for community providers. However, users can engage with the sites in different ways, which calls for a more diverse classification of participation, instead of a simple active–passive dichotomy. This systematic literature review discusses empirical studies on online community participation. The results indicate that despite the large amount of research conducted on the topic, a theoretical and conceptual framework for user participation remains undefined as most of the research has approached participation in terms of its quantity. The complexity of online participation and its implications for methodology in future studies is discussed.

Título: Using BIM to improve building energy efficiency – A scientometric and systematic review
Resumo: The Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO) sector is responsible for a great proportion of the global energy consumption and associated environmental impacts. On this front, and from a sustainability improvement perspective, the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) capabilities could represent an opportunity to improve these impacts in all steps of a building’s life. The main purpose of the current paper is to identify the areas in which BIM technology can or already is playing a role in improving building efficiency, helping AECO sector stakeholders in reducing environmental impacts. In the current paper, the impact of using BIM to enhance the building energy efficiency is explored through a scientometric analysis and a systematic literature review. There is a high interest among the scientific community in these fields, given the recent rise in publications and citation numbers. Moreover, there is a lack of interoperability between BIM and energy analysis tools, a high potential for integrating BIM with other technologies, such as thermography, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and monitoring, and a very positive impact from the use of BIM in the optimisation of construction solutions which allow energy savings in the AECO sector.

Título: Using game authoring platforms to develop screen-based simulated functional assessments in persons with executive dysfunction following traumatic brain injury
Resumo: The assessment of functional status is a critical component of clinical neuropsychological evaluations used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in patients with cognitive brain disorders. There are, however, no widely adopted neuropsychological tests that are both ecologically valid and easily administered in daily clinical practice. This discrepancy is a roadblock to the widespread adoption of functional assessments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using a serious game authoring platform (eAdventure) for creating screen-based simulated functional assessments. We created a naturalistic functional task that consisted of preparing a cup of tea (SBS-COT) and applied the assessment in a convenience sample of eight dyads of therapists/patients with mild executive dysfunction after traumatic brain injury. We had three main aims. First, we performed a comprehensive review of executive function assessment in activities of daily living. Second, we were interested in measuring the feasibility of this technology with respect to staffing, economic and technical requirements. Third, a serious game was administered to patients to study the feasibility of this technology in the clinical context (pre-screening test). In addition, quantitative (Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaires) and qualitative (semistructured interviews) evaluations were applied to obtain user input. Our results suggest that the staffing, economic and technical requirements of the SBS-COT are feasible. The outcomes of the pre-screening test provide evidence that this technology is useful in the functional assessment of patients with executive dysfunction. In relation to subjective data, the TAM questionnaire showed good user acceptability from a professional perspective. Interview analyses with professionals and patients showed positive experiences related to the use of the SBS-COT. Our work indicates that the use of these types of authoring platforms could have positive long-term implications for neuropsychological research, opening the door to more reproducible, cooperative and efficient research by allowing the facilitated production, reuse and sharing of neuropsychological assessment tools.

Título: Using personas to exploit environmental attitudes and behaviour in sustainable product design
Resumo: The aim of this research was to study the relationship between user sustainable design attitudes versus behaviour, and to develop and test environmental personas as design tools. Current approaches towards environmentally sustainable design are primarily focused on capturing the environmentally conscious and pro-environmental consumers, or changing the attitude and behaviour of the anti-environmental consumer. In a survey of 521 consumers, environmental attitude was a poor predictor of environmental behaviour. A series of interviews was performed with different profiles of environmentally orientated users to assess their environmental attitudes and behaviour. The survey and interview data were used to develop four personas, one for each of the environmental attitude and behaviour types based on data from the consumer survey. A case study performed with university design students found that concepts generated by groups using environmentally orientated personas scored higher on environmental sustainability versus those generated by groups using an image board. This study illustrates how user-centred design approaches could be used to embed sustainable design in products by exploiting consumer environmental behaviour to overcome different attitudes and behaviour.

Título: Visual Communication Methods and Tools for Sustainability Performance Assessment: Linking Academic and Industry Perspectives
Resumo: Effective decision-making based on quantitative analysis is limited by analysts’ abilities to visualize and interpret data and information, a critical challenge in sustainability performance assessment. Non-experts, including students and marketing/finance professionals, often lack experience in interpreting complex data and results, increasing the difficulty of evaluating product sustainability performance. A lack of robust and clear visualization frameworks represents a barrier in advancing the efficacy of sustainability analyses, the tools used for such analyses, and the decisions based on them, exacerbated by the gap between research and industry practice. Emerging and ongoing efforts are investigated by reviewing the research literature on the visual communication of quantitative sustainability performance information and by collecting direct input from sustainability assessment practitioners. While the communication of complicated and uncertain results is an active area of research, prior visualization tool development efforts in support of sustainable product, process, and supply chain design decision-making have found little commercial application. Viewed as a thorny challenge by practitioners, our analysis did not find universal guidance for visualization, but it did uncover best practices for presenting actionable sustainability analysis results that could provide a starting point. Based on the intersection of the literature analysis and primary source interviews, we provide a snapshot of the current state in the field and present potential research avenues.

Título: Visual tool for sustainable buildings: A design approach with various data visualisation techniques
Resumo: To tackle sustainability, the building sector has to take into account the life cycle impacts of buildings. However, due to the complexity of life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC), architects still have a huge hurdle to integrate LCA and LCC in their design processes and even more in the first design stage where the most important decisions are taken. To overcome the complexity, this research aims to develop a comprehensive visual approach in line with an architectural design process. Firstly, environmental impacts are translated into cost so that they can be integrated with financial cost in a life cycle costing approach. Secondly, various visualisations of this single unit result are selected, and a visual approach is elaborated, which supports an integration of life cycle approach in a design process. This paper demonstrates via a theoretical simplified case of dwellings in the Belgian context how the approach can support making more desirable design decisions. The proposed approach with a combined use of visualisations can be expected to enable architects integrating LCA and LCC results in their design loop thinking and easily overview the effect of their design decisions for sustainable dwellings.

Título: Why does site visit matter in global software development: A knowledge-based perspective
Resumo: Context Face-to-Face (F2F) interaction is a strong means to foster social relationships and effective knowledge sharing within a team. However, communication in Global Software Development (GSD) teams is usually restricted to computer-mediated conversation that is perceived to be less effective and interpersonal. Temporary collocation of dispersed members of a software development team is a well-known practice in GSD. Despite broad realization of the benefits of visits, there is lack of empirical evidence that explores how temporary F2F interactions are organized in practice and how they can impact knowledge sharing between sites. Objective This study aimed at empirically investigating activities that take place during temporary collocation of dispersed members and analyzing the outcomes of the visit for supporting and improving knowledge sharing. Method We report a longitudinal case study of a GSD team distributed between Denmark and Pakistan. We have explored a particular visit organized for a group of offshore team members visiting onshore site for two weeks. Our findings are based on a systematic and rigorous analysis of the calendar entries of the visitors during the studied visit, several observations of a selected set of the team members’ activities during the visit and 13 semi-structured interviews. Results Looking through the lens of knowledge-based theory of the firm, we have found that social and professional activities organized during the visit, facilitated knowledge sharing between team members from both sites. The findings are expected to contribute to building a common knowledge and understanding about the role and usefulness of the site visits for supporting and improving knowledge sharing in GSD teams by establishing and sustaining social and professional ties.
