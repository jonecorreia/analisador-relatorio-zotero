			<h2>A Comparison of Similarity Based Instance Selection Methods for Cross Project Defect Prediction</h2>

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>Context: Previous studies have shown that training data 
instance selection based on nearest neighborhood (NN) information can 
lead to better performance in cross project defect prediction (CPDP) by 
reducing heterogeneity in training datasets. However, neighborhood 
calculation is computationally expensive and approximate methods such as
 Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) can be as effective as exact methods. 
Aim: We aim at comparing instance selection methods for CPDP, namely 
LSH, NN-filter, and Genetic Instance Selection (GIS). Method: We conduct
 experiments with five base learners, optimizing their hyper parameters,
 on 13 datasets from PROMISE repository in order to compare the 
performance of LSH with benchmark instance selection methods NN-Filter 
and GIS. Results: The statistical tests show six distinct groups for 
F-measure performance. The top two group contains only LSH and GIS 
benchmarks whereas the bottom two groups contain only NN-Filter 
variants. LSH and GIS favor recall more than precision. In fact, for 
precision performance only three significantly distinct groups are 
detected by the tests where the top group is comprised of NN-Filter 
variants only. Recall wise, 16 different groups are identified where the
 top three groups contain only LSH methods, four of the next six are GIS
 only and the bottom five contain only NN-Filter. Finally, NN-Filter 
benchmarks never outperform the LSH counterparts with the same base 
learner, tuned or non-tuned. Further, they never even belong to the same
 rank group, meaning that LSH is always significantly better than 
NN-Filter with the same learner and settings. Conclusions: The increase 
in performance and the decrease in computational overhead and runtime 
make LSH a promising approach. However, the performance of LSH is based 
on high recall and in environments where precision is considered more 
important NN-Filter should be considered.</td>

						<td>Business Intelligence (BI) is regarded by executives as a 
critical practice to adopt and invest in. The purpose of this research 
is to develop a categorized typology of skills required by BI 
professionals. A review of extant literature resulted in the 
identification of twenty three skills. The research aimed to validate 
these skills, and add additional skills to this typology based on the 
experiences of BI professionals within industry. These experiences were 
captured through interviews. Skills were then categorized by identifying
 commonalities across them. No additional skills were identified by the 
interviewed participants. A categorized typology of skills was developed
 which grouped the initial twenty three skills into seven higher order 
categories. The seven categories of skills were identified as: (1) 
Prepare data for subject matter expert (SME), analyst or other external 
party for further analysis; (2) Apply simulation modelling, statistical 
techniques and provide business insight; (3) Manage stakeholders and 
project and operational tasks; (4) Develop strategic long term BI 
roadmap that links to corporate strategy; (5) Understand business 
processes in order to effectively extract user requirements; (6) Design 
and code sustainable solutions; (7) Absorb and distribute knowledge.</td>

<p>Business Intelligence (BI) is regarded by executives as a critical 
practice to adopt and invest in. The purpose of this research is to 
develop a categorized typology of skills required by BI professionals. A
 review of extant literature resulted in the identification of twenty 
three skills. The research aimed to validate these skills, and add 
additional skills to this typology based on the experiences of BI 
professionals within industry. These experiences were captured through 
interviews. Skills were then categorized by identifying commonalities 
across them. No additional skills were identified by the interviewed 
participants. A categorized typology of skills was developed which 
grouped the initial twenty three skills into seven higher order 
categories. The seven categories of skills were identified as: (1) 
Prepare data for subject matter expert (SME), analyst or other external 
party for further analysis; (2) Apply simulation modelling, statistical 
techniques and provide business insight; (3) Manage stakeholders and 
project and operational tasks; (4) Develop strategic long term BI 
roadmap that links to corporate strategy; (5) Understand business 
processes in order to effectively extract user requirements; (6) Design 
and code sustainable solutions; (7) Absorb and distribute knowledge.</p>

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>The use of multi-touch systems has been increasing in the last
 few years. These systems also need to pass through an evaluation to 
check their quality level. For this, usability and User Experience (UX) 
are two important aspects. Seeking to find out which technologies are 
being used for this purpose, we performed a Systematic Mapping Study 
(SMS). We discover that no technologies are being used to evaluate 
usability and UX on multi-touch interfaces that consider the 
specificities of this context, such as lack of touch precision and 
mechanical feedback. We proposed the User Experience and usability 
Multi-touch Evaluation Questionnaire (UXUMEQ) to fill this gap. This 
technology was evaluated through a feasibility study performed with 47 
participants. Efficiency and effectiveness were compared to a 
combination of the System usability Scale (SUS) and Intuitive 
Questionnaire (INTUI). According to quantitative results, UXUMEQ 
presented a statistically significant difference over SUS+INTUI in terms
 of efficiency, while in effectiveness the comparison remained similar. 
In other words, UXUMEQ allows the users to find more problems, though it
 cannot be said that it saves time in this search compared to SUS+INTUI.
 UXUMEQ was considered easy to use, proposal-fulfilling, and highly 
assertive by the study participants. The qualitative data was analyzed 
and generated in a new version of UXUMEQ.</td>

						<td>Software Cloning is the typical example where an 
interdisciplinary approach may bring additional elements into the 
community's discussion. In fact, little research has been done in its 
analysis from an Intellectual Propriety Rights (IPRs) perspective, even 
if it is a widely studied aspect of software engineering. An 
interdisciplinary approach is crucial to better understand the legal 
implications of software in the IPR context. Interestingly, the academic
 community of software and systems deals much more with such IPR issues 
than courts themselves. In this paper, we analyze some recent legal 
decisions in using software clones from a software engineering 
perspective. In particular, we survey the behavior of some major courts 
about cloning issues. As a major outcome of our research, it seems that 
legal fora do not have major concerns regarding copyright infringements 
in software cloning. The major contribution of this work is a case by 
case analysis of more than one hundred judgments by the US courts and 
the European Court of Justice. We compare the US and European courts 
case laws and discuss the impact of a recent European ruling. The US and
 EU contexts are quite different, since in the US software is patentable
 while in the EU it is not. Hence, European courts look more permissive 
regarding cloning, since "principles," or "ideas," are not copyrightable
 by themselves.</td>

						<td>Users can today download a wide variety of apps ranging from 
simple toy games to sophisticated business-critical apps. They rely on 
these apps daily to perform diverse tasks, some of them related to 
sensitive information such as their finance or health. Ensuring 
high-quality, reliable, and secure apps is thus key. In the TruX 
research group of the interdisciplinary center for Security, 
Reliability, and Trust (SnT) of the University of Luxembourg, we are 
working for about 10 years to deliver practical techniques, tools, and 
other artifacts (such as repositories) making the analysis of Android 
apps possible. In this paper, we will briefly introduce our key 
contributions in both (1) Android app static analysis to detect security
 issues, and (2) Android Malware Detection with machine learning. We 
will conclude by listing several open challenges that we are currently 
facing towards improving the analysis and security of Android apps.</td>

						<td>With the rise of open-source software and package hosting 
platforms, reusing 3rd-party libraries has become a common practice. Due
 to various failures during software evolution, a project may remove a 
used library and replace it with another library, which we call library 
migration. Despite substantial research on dependency management, the 
understanding of how and why library migrations occur is still lacking. 
Achieving this understanding may help practitioners optimize their 
library selection criteria, develop automated approaches to monitor 
dependencies, and provide migration suggestions for their libraries or 
software projects. In this paper, through a fine-grained commit-level 
analysis of 19,652 Java GitHub projects, we extract the largest 
migration dataset to-date (1,194 migration rules, 3,163 migration 
commits). We show that 8,065 (41.04%) projects having at least one 
library removal, 1,564 (7.96%, lower-bound) to 5,004 (25.46%, 
upper-bound) projects have at least one migration, and a median project 
with migrations has 2 to 4 migrations in total. We discover that library
 migrations are dominated by several domains (logging, JSON, testing and
 web service) presenting a long tail distribution. Also, migrations are 
highly unidirectional in that libraries are either mostly abandoned or 
mostly chosen in our project corpus. A thematic analysis on related 
commit messages, issues, and pull requests identifies 14 frequently 
mentioned migration reasons (e.g., lack of maintenance, usability, 
integration, etc), 7 of which are not discussed in previous work. Our 
findings can be operationalized into actionable insights for package 
hosting platforms, project maintainers, and library developers. We

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>Systems-of-Systems (SoSs) have risen in response to needs of 
achieving complex missions that can be only carried out from the 
cooperation among diverse, independent constituent systems. 
Understanding of missions and emergent behaviors in SoSs as well as the 
complicated interactions among constituent systems are a quite time 
demanding and challenging tasks. In another perspective, reference 
architectures (RAs) are a special type of software architecture that 
promotes reuse of knowledge to develop and evolve software systems, and 
mainly to promote interoperability among software systems. In spite of 
the relevance of RAs, these architectures have not still incorporated 
the concept of missions of SoSs and how to adequately manage them. 
Hence, such RAs have presented a limited ability to support SoSs 
development and evolution. In this scenario, the main contribution of 
this paper is to improve the feasibility of RAs in developing SoSs. For 
this, we present a systematic process to establish, model, and validate 
missions of SoSs and also incorporate them into RAs. To evaluate our 
process, we applied it in a RA for SoSs in the healthcare domain.

<p>Systems-of-Systems (SoSs) have risen in response to needs of 
achieving complex missions that can be only carried out from the 
cooperation among diverse, independent constituent systems. 
Understanding of missions and emergent behaviors in SoSs as well as the 
complicated interactions among constituent systems are a quite time 
demanding and challenging tasks. In another perspective, reference 
architectures (RAs) are a special type of software architecture that 
promotes reuse of knowledge to develop and evolve software systems, and 
mainly to promote interoperability among software systems. In spite of 
the relevance of RAs, these architectures have not still incorporated 
the concept of missions of SoSs and how to adequately manage them. 
Hence, such RAs have presented a limited ability to support SoSs 
development and evolution. In this scenario, the main contribution of 
this paper is to improve the feasibility of RAs in developing SoSs. For 
this, we present a systematic process to establish, model, and validate 
missions of SoSs and also incorporate them into RAs. To evaluate our 
process, we applied it in a RA for SoSs in the healthcare domain. 
Results achieved until now show that RAs designed considering our 
process could contribute to decrease expended time and effort at early 
stages of SoSs engineering.</p>

						<td>Context: Existing empirical evidence indicates that loss of

In software engineering research, mental fatigue may affect the results 
of study selection (an auditory task) when conducting secondary studies 
such as systematic literature reviews or systematic mapping studies. 
However, to date there is no empirical study that reports an in-depth 
investigation about the relationship between mental fatigue and

preliminary results do not indicate that mental fatigue negatively 
impacts the correctness of selection decision and confidence. However, 
it is important to note that the preliminary results are only based on 
six subjects.Conclusion: This paper brings awareness about the role of 
mental fatigue in the conduction of secondary studies. Although the 
preliminary results do not indicate any meaningful relationship, we

						<td>Harmful software has resulted in loss of life, societal and 
environmental damage alongside economic losses from fines and sales 
embargoes. When someone perceives their team or organisation is creating
 or operating harmful software (e.g., defective, vulnerable, malicious 
or illegal), one way to attempt to change the situation is to "blow the 
whistle" and disclose the situation internally or externally. Studying 
harmful situations and the effectiveness of interventions, up to and 
including whistleblowing, can help identify technical and human 
successes and failings in software engineering (SE).The aim of this 
paper is to explore the extent to which whistle-blowing is studied in SE
 with the objective of identifying themes, research approaches, gaps and
 concerns, and the implications for future SE research and practice.We 
find that whistleblowing is an under-explored area of SE research, and 
where research exists, it often takes the view that reporting harm is a 
matter of individual moral responsibility; we argue this poorly reflects
 SE collaborative practice where professional responsibilities are 
distributed across the software development lifecycle. We conclude by 1)
 recommending approaches that can help a more timely identification and 
mitigation of harm in SE; 2) suggesting mechanisms for improving the 
effectiveness and the personal safety of harm-reporting in SE, and 3) 
reflecting on the role that professional bodies can have in supporting 
harm reporting, up to and including whistleblowing.</td>

<p>Harmful software has resulted in loss of life, societal and 
environmental damage alongside economic losses from fines and sales 
embargoes. When someone perceives their team or organisation is creating
 or operating harmful software (e.g., defective, vulnerable, malicious 
or illegal), one way to attempt to change the situation is to "blow the 
whistle" and disclose the situation internally or externally. Studying 
harmful situations and the effectiveness of interventions, up to and 
including whistleblowing, can help identify technical and human 
successes and failings in software engineering (SE).The aim of this 
paper is to explore the extent to which whistle-blowing is studied in SE
 with the objective of identifying themes, research approaches, gaps and
 concerns, and the implications for future SE research and practice.We 
find that whistleblowing is an under-explored area of SE research, and 
where research exists, it often takes the view that reporting harm is a 
matter of individual moral responsibility; we argue this poorly reflects
 SE collaborative practice where professional responsibilities are 
distributed across the software development lifecycle. We conclude by 1)
 recommending approaches that can help a more timely identification and 
mitigation of harm in SE; 2) suggesting mechanisms for improving the 
effectiveness and the personal safety of harm-reporting in SE, and 3) 
reflecting on the role that professional bodies can have in supporting 
harm reporting, up to and including whistleblowing.</p>

						<td>Nowadays, sustainability is a key factor that should be 
considered in the software quality models. It is increasingly important 
how environmentally friendly is a software product, both in its 
execution and during its development process. Therefore, we have 
proposed, in a previous work, a quality model (25010+S) an extension of 
the ISO/IEC 25010 standard by considering aspects of sustainability on 
its characteristics and sub-characteristics. However, in order to make 
the model useful, it is necessary to identify measures for each 
sub-characteristic and characteristic. For that reason, the objective of
 this paper is to carry out a Systematic Literature Review to discover 
the stateof-the art in software sustainability measures.</td>

<p>Nowadays, sustainability is a key factor that should be considered in
 the software quality models. It is increasingly important how 
environmentally friendly is a software product, both in its execution 
and during its development process. Therefore, we have proposed, in a 
previous work, a quality model (25010+S) an extension of the ISO/IEC 
25010 standard by considering aspects of sustainability on its 
characteristics and sub-characteristics. However, in order to make the 
model useful, it is necessary to identify measures for each 
sub-characteristic and characteristic. For that reason, the objective of
 this paper is to carry out a Systematic Literature Review to discover 
the state-of-the art in software sustainability measures.</p>

<p>Hoje em dia, a sustentabilidade é um fator-chave que deve ser 
considerado nos modelos de qualidade de software. É cada vez mais 
importante avaliar o quão amigável ao meio ambiente é um produto de 
software, tanto em sua execução quanto durante seu processo de 
desenvolvimento. Portanto, propusemos, em um trabalho anterior, um 
modelo de qualidade (25010+S), uma extensão do padrão ISO/IEC 25010 que 
considera aspectos de sustentabilidade em suas características e 
subcaracterísticas. No entanto, para tornar o modelo útil, é necessário 
identificar medidas para cada subcaracterística e característica. Por 
essa razão, o objetivo deste artigo é realizar uma Revisão Sistemática 
da Literatura para descobrir o estado da arte em medidas de 
sustentabilidade de software.</p>

						<td>The links between the software architecture and the source 
code of a software system should be based on solid traceability 
mechanisms in order to effectively perform quality control and 
maintenance of the software system. There are several primary studies on
 traceability between software architecture and source code but so far 
no systematic literature review (SLR) has been undertaken. This study 
presents an SLR which has been carried out to discover the existing 
traceability approaches and tools between software architecture and 
source code, as well as the empirical evidence for these approaches, 
their benefits and liabilities, their relations to software architecture
 understanding, and issues, barriers, and challenges of the approaches. 
In our SLR the ACM Guide to Computing Literature has been electronically
 searched to accumulate the biggest share of relevant scientific 
bibliographic citations from the major publishers in computing. The 
search strategy identified 742 citations, out of which 11 have been 
included in our study, dated from 1999 to July, 2013, after applying our
 inclusion and exclusion criteria. Our SLR resulted in the 
identification of the current state-of-the-art of traceability 
approaches and tools between software architecture and source code, as 
well as gaps and pointers for further research. Moreover, the 
classification scheme developed in this paper can serve as a guide for 
researchers and practitioners to find a specific approach or set of 
approaches that is of interest to them.</td>

result, there are already important contributions in that direction; 
however, there is a lack of consensus on how better dealing with these

could be achieved and which aspects of the SoS architectural

<p>Background: Measuring an organization's capability to innovate and 
assessing its innovation output and performance is a challenging task. 
Previously, a comprehensive model and a suite of measurements to support
 this task were proposed. Aims: In the current paper, seven years since 
the publication of the paper titled Towards innovation measurement in 
the software industry, we have reflected on the impact of the work. 
Method: We have mainly relied on quantitative and qualitative analysis 
of the citations of the paper using an established classification 
schema. Results: We found that the article has had a significant 
scientific impact (indicated by the number of citations), i.e., (1) 
cited in literature from both software engineering and other fields, (2)
 cited in grey literature and peer-reviewed literature, and (3) 
substantial citations in literature not published in the English 
language. However, we consider a majority of the citations in the 
peer-reviewed literature (75 out of 116) as neutral, i.e., they have not
 used the innovation measurement paper in any substantial way. All in 
all, 38 out of 116 have used, modified or based their work on the 
definitions, measurements or the model proposed in the article. This 
analysis revealed a significant weakness of the citing work, i.e., among
 the citing papers, we found only two explicit comparisons to the 
innovation measurement proposal, and we found no papers that identify 
weaknesses of said proposal. Conclusions: This work highlights the need 
for being cautious of relying solely on the number of citations for 
understanding impact, and the need for further improving and supporting 
the peer-review process to identify unwarranted citations in papers.</p>

						<td>Context: A system of systems is an assemblage of components 
which individually may be regarded as systems, and which possesses the 
additional properties that the constituent systems are operationally 
independent, and are managerially independent. Much has been published 
about the field of systems of systems by researchers and practitioners, 
often with the assertion that the system-of-systems design context 
necessitates the use of architecture approaches that are somewhat 
different from system-level architecture. However, no systematic review 
has been conducted to provide an extensive overview of system of systems
 architecture research.Objective: This paper presents such a systematic 
review. The objective of this review is to classify and provide a 
thematic analysis of the reported results in system of systems 
architecture.Method: The primary studies for the systematic review were 
identified using a predefined search strategy followed by an extensive 
manual selection process.Results: We found the primary studies published
 in a large number of venues, mostly domain-oriented, with no obvious 
center of a research community of practice. The field seems to be 
maturing more slowly than other software technologies: Most reported 
results described individuals or teams working in apparent isolation to 
develop solutions to particular system-of-systems architecture problems,
 with no techniques gaining widespread adoption.Conclusions: A 
comprehensive research agenda for this field should be developed, and 
further studies should be performed to determine whether the information
 system-related problems of system of systems architecture are covered 
by existing software architecture knowledge, and if not, to develop 
general methods for system-of-systems architecture.</td>

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>Context: In order to preserve the value of Systematic Reviews 
(SRs), they should be frequently updated considering new evidence that 
has been produced since the completion of the previous version of the 
reviews. However, the update of an SR is a time consuming, manual task. 
Thus, many SRs have not been updated as they should be and, therefore, 
they are currently outdated. Objective: The main contribution of this 
paper is to support the update of SRs. Method: We propose USR-VTM, an 
approach based on Visual Text Mining (VTM) techniques, to support 
selection of new evidence in the form of primary studies. We then 
present a tool, named Revis, which supports our approach. Finally, we 
evaluate our approach through a comparison of outcomes achieved using 
USR-VTM versus the traditional (manual) approach. Results: Our results 
show that USR-VTM increases the number of studies correctly included 
compared to the traditional approach. Conclusions: USR-VTM effectively 
supports the update of SRs.</td>

<p>Context: In order to preserve the value of Systematic Reviews (SRs), 
they should be frequently updated considering new evidence that has been
 produced since the completion of the previous version of the reviews. 
However, the update of an SR is a time consuming, manual task. Thus, 
many SRs have not been updated as they should be and, therefore, they 
are currently outdated. Objective: The main contribution of this paper 
is to support the update of SRs. Method: We propose USR-VTM, an approach
 based on Visual Text Mining (VTM) techniques, to support selection of 
new evidence in the form of primary studies. We then present a tool, 
named Revis, which supports our approach. Finally, we evaluate our 
approach through a comparison of outcomes achieved using USR-VTM versus 
the traditional (manual) approach. Results: Our results show that 
USR-VTM increases the number of studies correctly included compared to 
the traditional approach. Conclusions: USR-VTM effectively supports the 
update of SRs.</p>

						<td>Technological advances have made notable changes in the way 
healthcare services can be received and delivered today. Telemedicine is
 a form of virtual healthcare service that is convenient in context of 
time commitments, cost, and in-person availability. Despite its 
benefits, the adoption of telemedicine remains challenged with 
technology constraints, including security and privacy issues that pose 
risks. Existing research literature shows that there have been some 
prior survey studies on the security and privacy risks in telemedicine 
systems. However, none of these previous works have holistically 
surveyed the telemedicine security and privacy issues, using their 
networking layer locations, their causes, and their potential impacts on
 information flow. In this research study, we survey existing works on 
telemedicine security plus privacy, and come up with a unique way of 
classifying the surveyed literature using a noteworthy W3H2 analysis 
approach, which reviews and organizes the prior literature in terms of 
the locations, causes, potential impacts, and remedies related to the 
telemedicine security issues. We also discuss existing research gaps 
plus open research directions on the topic. The highlight of this study 
is our nifty W3H2 analysis approach, which makes use of simple yet 
notable research questions, as well as the seven layered OSI network 
architecture model, unlike previous survey studies on telemedicine 
security. We end up creating a multi-layer, novel taxonomy framework for
 effective presentation plus categorization of our surveyed literature.</td>

						<td>We describe a methodology and a technology supporting an 
intervention carried out by Public Health England (PHE) to encourage 
physically inactive people (doing less than 30 minutes' physical 
activity per week) to initiate regular physical activity via 10 minutes 
of daily brisk walking. The intervention is designed to encourage the 
inclusion of short bouts of continuous brisk walking in everyday 
activities such as shopping or commuting. To this extent a behaviour 
change mobile application, Active 10, was developed and distributed 
freely for Android and iOS. The app was downloaded over 620,000 times 
and our server infrastructure has collected nearly a billion data points
 between March 2017 and January 2019. The paper describes the rationale 
for Active 10, the application supporting the intervention, the data 
architecture and the data collection approach. Then we discuss the 
complexity of developing a health tracking technology with such large 
number of users, producing a significant volume of data. Finally, we 
describe a preliminary data analysis, focussing on a cohort of 129,010 
users who used the app for over 8 weeks: 73% of these users achieved 
less than ten minutes of brisk walking per day during the first week; by
 the end of the 8th week this subset of users showed, on average, a 
10-fold increase in brisk walking. The most inactive section of the 
cohort, the 54% of users who showed virtually no brisk walking activity 
during week 1, seems to achieve the greatest proportional increase, and 
by the end of week 8 they appear to meet, on average, 10 minutes of 
continuous brisk walking per day. The increase is more evident within 
the 15% of the cohort who kept the app for over six months: on average a
 12% increase in average activity was observed in this group with no 
sign of decline.</td>

week 8 they appear to meet, on average, 10 minutes of continuous brisk 
walking per day. The increase is more evident within the 15% of the 
cohort who kept the app for over six months: on average a 12% increase 
in average activity was observed in this group with no sign of decline.</p>

software development (ASD) has become an appealing choice for companies 
attempting to improve their performance although its methods were

development: how to do it, who, and what works in practice. This study 
aims to highlight how ASD practices are applied in the context of GSD in
 order to develop a set of techniques that can be relevant in both 
research and practice. To answer the research question, "how are agile 
practices adopted in agile global software development teams?" We 
conducted a systematic literature review of the ASD and GSD literature. A
 synthesis of solutions found in seventy-six studies provided 48 
distinct practices that organizations can implement, including 
"collaboration among teams", "agile architecture", "coaching", "system 
demo" and "test automation". These implementable practices go some way 
towards providing solutions to manage GSD teams, and thus to embrace 
agility.</td>

						<td>Driven by the need for faster time-to-market and reduced 
development lead-time, large-scale systems engineering companies are 
adopting agile methods in their organizations. This agile transformation
 is challenging and it is common that adoption starts bottom-up with 
agile software teams within the context of traditional company 
structures. This creates the challenge of agile teams working within a 
document-centric and plan-driven (or waterfall) environment. While it 
may be desirable to take the best of both worlds, it is not clear how 
that can be achieved especially with respect to managing requirements in
 large-scale systems. This paper presents an exploratory case study 
focusing on two departments of a large-scale systems engineering company
 (automotive) that is in the process of company-wide agile adoption. We 
present challenges that agile teams face while working within a larger 
plan-driven context and propose potential strategies to mitigate the 
challenges. Challenges relate to, e.g., development teams not being 
aware of the high-level requirements, difficulties to manage change of 
these requirements as well as their relationship to backlog items such 
as user stories. While we found strategies for solving most of the 
challenges, they remain abstract and empirical research on their 
effectiveness is currently lacking.</td>

						<td>Software development depends on various factors and

development, with its emphasis on agility, has received much attention. 
Research so far has focused on the constructs that define agility and 
also identified the reasons that limit teams from exhibiting all the 
constructs of agile software development. This lead to re-defining 
agility by using economic, quality, simplicity and the relationship with
 the environment it operates on. One of the factors that contribute to 
relationship with environment is organizational culture. Though 
relationship of organizational culture and software methods is not new, 
analyzing the relationship further in the new defined definition of

paper a qualitative research method of multiple case-studies consisting 
of 3 releases of one product development team was selected. Data was 
collected using participant-observation method. Research findings have 
identified some useful insights that could provide researchers and 
practitioners to develop software development life-cycle that 
incorporates existing agile methods and uses diverse set of methods to 
resolve issues including organizational issues. Thereby the new software
 development life-cycle would not distinguish between agile and

						<td>Models of complex systems and systems of systems are described
 with NAF (NATO Architecture Framework) or DoDAF (DoD Architecture 
Framework). Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is part of NAF 
and allows describing the behaviour of the different participants in the
 model. This notation is used by the French Army as well as its main 
suppliers to describe the interactions between participants involved in a
 mission. It is therefore important the models are correct. The VeriMoB 
project was a research project financed by the DGA (Direction Générale 
de l'Armement) which aimed at developing a tool that will help users to 
validate their BPMN models among the stakeholders. The tool had to cover
 three main aspects: a static verification, an interactive execution, 
and an automatic exploration of the possible scenarios. This paper will 
present the work done trying to convert BPMN to SDL in order to fulfil 
this objective with an existing toolset.</td>

<p>Models of complex systems and systems of systems are described with 
NAF (NATO Architecture Framework) or DoDAF (DoD Architecture Framework).
 Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is part of NAF and allows 
describing the behaviour of the different participants in the model. 
This notation is used by the French Army as well as its main suppliers 
to describe the interactions between participants involved in a mission.
 It is therefore important the models are correct. The VeriMoB project 
was a research project financed by the DGA (Direction Générale de 
l'Armement) which aimed at developing a tool that will help users to 
validate their BPMN models among the stakeholders. The tool had to cover
 three main aspects: a static verification, an interactive execution, 
and an automatic exploration of the possible scenarios. This paper will 
present the work done trying to convert BPMN to SDL in order to fulfil 
this objective with an existing toolset.</p>

						<td>Context: Two of the most common external threats to validity 
in quantitative studies in software engineering (SE) are concerned with 
defining the population by convenience and nonrandom sampling 
assignment. Although these limitations can be reduced by increasing the 
number of replications and aggregating their results, the acquired 
evidence rarely can be generalized to the field.Objective: To 
investigate the state of practice of meta-analysis in SE and its 
limitations, intending to propose an alternative perspective to 
understand the relationships among experimentation, production, threats 
to validity and evidence. To propose and evaluate means to strengthen 
quantitative studies in software engineering and making them less risky 
due to population and sampling issues.Method: To use the underlying idea
 from the Theory of Food Chains to alternatively understand the impact 
of external threats to validity in the SE experimental cycle 
(experimental chains). Next, to accomplish an initial technical 
literature survey to observe basic features of secondary studies 
aggregating primary studies results. Third, to organize a set of 
experimental chain's concepts and make initial discussions regarding the

applying the experimental chains concepts it was initially observed 
that, although important and necessary, most of the current effort in 
the conduction of quantitative studies in SE does not produce (mainly 
due to population/sampling constraints) results strong enough to 
positively impact the engineering of software. It promotes an imbalance 
between research and practice. However, more investigation is necessary 
to support this claim.Conclusion: We argue that research energy has been
 lost in SE studies due to population/sampling constraints. Therefore, 
we believe more investigation must be undertaken to understand how 
better organizing, enlarging, setting up and sampling SE quantitative 
studies' population by using, for instance, alternative technologies

						<td>Software Engineering researchers and practitioners have sought
 a systematic way of characterizing technical and social behaviors in 
software development, from the perspective of either an artifact (e.g. 
design pattern) or an actor (e.g. developer). In this context, 
influencers are those who guide the development methods and disseminate 
patterns due to their popularity or status in the community. Especially 
in software ecosystems, the dynamics of interactions with interventions 
of external developers over a common technological platform leverage the
 effects of influence and still remains as a challenge. This paper 
presents an exploratory study on the sense of influence in open source 
software ecosystems, more specifically from the opinions of 95 
developers who contribute to npm projects based on GitHub. To do so, 
qualitative data from a conducted survey research were analyzed based on
 Grounded Theory (GT) procedures. Based on two main categories 
(Technical and Social), we recognized aspects that reinforce some key 
characteristics of an influencer, e.g., 'status in the project', 
'participation with code', 'participation with comments ', and 'content 
value'. However, some diverging aspects were observed, e.g., the 
difference between qualitative and quantitative responses related to 
'long-time interaction with the project'. This study contributes with 
the identification of influencers' characteristics that can aid both 
researchers in further studies on open source software ecosystems and 
practitioners in strategies to manage project-based ecosystems.</td>

test-last development (TLD) approach through a randomized controlled 
trial. The results failed to support the claims. Goal: We want to 
validate the original study results by replicating it at the University 
of Basilicata (Italy), using a different design. Method: We replicated 
the baseline experiment, using a crossover design, with 21 graduate 
students. We kept the settings and context as close as possible to the 
baseline experiment. In order to limit researchers bias, we involved two
 other sites (UPM, Spain, and Brunel, UK) to conduct blind analysis of 
the data. Results: The Kruskal-Wallis tests did not show any significant
 difference between TDD and TLD in terms of testing effort (p-value = 
.27), external code quality (p-value = .82), and developers' 
productivity (p-value = .83). Nevertheless, our data revealed a 
difference based on the order in which TDD and TLD were applied, though 
no carry over effect. Conclusions: We verify the baseline study results,
 yet our results raises concerns regarding the selection of experimental
 objects, particularly with respect to their interaction with the order 
in which of treatments are applied.We recommend future studies to survey
 the tasks used in experiments evaluating TDD. Finally, to lower the 
cost of replication studies and reduce researchers' bias, we encourage 
other research groups to adopt similar multi-site blind analysis 
approach described in this paper.</td>

<p>Context: Test-driven development (TDD) is an agile practice claimed 
to improve the quality of a software product, as well as the 
productivity of its developers. A previous study (i.e., baseline 
experiment) at the University of Oulu (Finland) compared TDD to a 
test-last development (TLD) approach through a randomized controlled 
trial. The results failed to support the claims. Goal: We want to 
validate the original study results by replicating it at the University

						<td>Test smells represent a set of poorly designed tests, which 
can harm a test code’s maintenance and quality criteria. Although 
fundamental steps to understand test smells have been investigated, 
there is still an evident lack of studies evaluating the impact of test 
smell refactoring from internal quality attributes, such as size, 
cohesion, coupling, and complexity. In addition, the literature still 
lacks research that addresses the difficulties developers encounter 
during test smell refactoring. The paper investigates the impact of test
 smell refactoring from developers’ perspectives and internal quality 
attributes. We investigated the perceptions and difficulties encountered
 by 20 developers while removing 5 types of test smells in 4 open-source
 projects over two months. Through this experiment, we analyzed: (i) the
 impact that test smell refactoring has on internal quality attributes; 
(ii) developers’ perception of test smells as actual problems within a 
software system; and (iii) main difficulties encountered by developers 
during test smell refactoring. Our findings can help developers design a
 prioritization scheme for test smell refactoring and make them aware of
 the real benefits of test smell refactoring.</td>

test smell refactoring. The paper investigates the impact of test smell 
refactoring from developers’ perspectives and internal quality 
attributes. We investigated the perceptions and difficulties encountered
 by 20 developers while removing 5 types of test smells in 4 open-source
 projects over two months. Through this experiment, we analyzed: (i) the
 impact that test smell refactoring has on internal quality attributes; 
(ii) developers’ perception of test smells as actual problems within a 
software system; and (iii) main difficulties encountered by developers 
during test smell refactoring. Our findings can help developers design a
 prioritization scheme for test smell refactoring and make them aware of
 the real benefits of test smell refactoring.</p>

						<td>Microservice architecture has gained much attention in the

architectural style that enables developing systems as a suite of small 
loosely coupled, and autonomous (micro)services that encapsulate 
business capabilities and communicate with each other using 
language-agnostic APIs. Despite the microservice adoption for 
modernizing legacy systems, few studies investigate how microservices 
are used in practice. Furthermore, the literature still scarce on

goal is to investigate if industry and academy are speaking the same

microservices, by means of a rigorous study on the use of microservices 
in the industry. For doing so, we design a survey to understand the 
state of practice from the perspective of a modernization process 
roadmap derived from the literature. In this paper, we report the 
results of a survey with 56 software companies, from which 35 (63.6%) 
adopt the microservice architecture in their legacy systems. Results 
pointed out the most expected benefits that drive the migration to 
microservices are easier software maintenance, better scalability, ease 
of deployment, and technology flexibility. Besides, we verified, based 
on a set of activities defined in the modernization process, that the 
practitioners are performing their migration process according to the

						<td>Conversational programmers want to learn about code primarily 
to communicate with technical co-workers, not to develop software. 
However, existing instructional materials don’t meet the needs of 
conversational programmers because they prioritize syntax and semantics 
over concepts and applications. This mismatch results in feelings of 
failure and low self-efficacy. To motivate conversational programmers, 
we propose purpose-first programming, a new approach that focuses on 
learning a handful of domain-specific code patterns and assembling them 
to create authentic and useful programs. We report on the development of
 a purpose-first programming prototype that teaches five patterns in the
 domain of web scraping. We show that learning with purpose-first

<p>Conversational programmers want to learn about code primarily to 
communicate with technical co-workers, not to develop software. However,
 existing instructional materials don’t meet the needs of conversational
 programmers because they prioritize syntax and semantics over concepts 
and applications. This mismatch results in feelings of failure and low 
self-efficacy. To motivate conversational programmers, we propose 
purpose-first programming, a new approach that focuses on learning a 
handful of domain-specific code patterns and assembling them to create 
authentic and useful programs. We report on the development of a 
purpose-first programming prototype that teaches five patterns in the 
domain of web scraping. We show that learning with purpose-first 
programming is motivating for conversational programmers because it 
engenders a feeling of success and aligns with these learners’ goals. 
Purpose-first programming learning enabled novice conversational 
programmers to complete scaffolded code writing, debugging, and 
explaining activities after only 30 minutes of instruction.</p>

			<h2>Balancing Resources and Load: Eleven Nontechnical Phenomena That Contribute to Formation or Persistence of Technical Debt</h2>

						<td>Technical approaches to effective technical debt 
management—metrics, descriptors, transformation tools, and the like—are 
necessary but insufficient. We must also address drivers of technical 
debt that lie in the realm of psychology, politics, finance, and policy.
 The open question is: Will organizations exploit the impressive 
technology-based advancements in technical debt management to make 
engineers more effective? Or will they do something else with the cost 
savings those technologies generate? Psychology, politics, finance, and 
policy play critical roles in determining whether we gain control of 
technical debt.For example, if engineering groups become more adept at 
managing and preventing technical debt, while marketing and sales groups
 do not improve their own processes, the demands of marketing and sales 
groups for new products and capabilities might be associated with even 
shorter timelines than they now are. Schedule pressure usually results. 
Consequently, enterprise agility and engineering productivity might not 
benefit from the new technology-based technical debt management 
capabilities, even though the burden of technical debt might be reduced.
 Absent a significant change in the behavior of non-technologists, we 
can expect the effects of nontechnical causes of technical debt to 
persist, and possibly even to increase in significance.In this paper we 
explore eleven nontechnical phenomena that contribute to technical debt 
formation and persistence. We describe each one, and recommend lines of 
inquiry that can suggest (a) the significance of the phenomenon's 
effects on technical debt, from an organizational behavior perspective; 
(b) technologies that could aid in assessing that significance, and 
which could eventually aid in mitigating the phenomenon's deleterious 
effects; or (c) changes to phenomenon-related policy or accounting 
methods that could reduce the rate of formation or the persistence of 
technical debt.</td>

						<td>Code review is a critical step in modern software quality 
assurance, yet it is vulnerable to human biases. Previous studies have 
clarified the extent of the problem, particularly regarding biases 
against the authors of code,but no consensus understanding has emerged. 
Advances in medical imaging are increasingly applied to software 
engineering, supporting grounded neurobiological explorations of 
computing activities, including the review, reading, and writing of 
source code. In this paper, we present the results of a controlled 
experiment using both medical imaging and also eye tracking to 
investigate the neurological correlates of biases and differences 
between genders of humans and machines (e.g., automated program repair 
tools) in code review. We find that men and women conduct code reviews 
differently, in ways that are measurable and supported by behavioral, 
eye-tracking and medical imaging data. We also find biases in how humans
 review code as a function of its apparent author, when controlling for 
code quality. In addition to advancing our fundamental understanding of 
how cognitive biases relate to the code review process, the results may 
inform subsequent training and tool design to reduce bias.</td>

<p>Code review is a critical step in modern software quality assurance, 
yet it is vulnerable to human biases. Previous studies have clarified 
the extent of the problem, particularly regarding biases against the 
authors of code,but no consensus understanding has emerged. Advances in 
medical imaging are increasingly applied to software engineering, 
supporting grounded neurobiological explorations of computing 
activities, including the review, reading, and writing of source code. 
In this paper, we present the results of a controlled experiment using 
both medical imaging and also eye tracking to investigate the 
neurological correlates of biases and differences between genders of 
humans and machines (e.g., automated program repair tools) in code 
review. We find that men and women conduct code reviews differently, in 
ways that are measurable and supported by behavioral, eye-tracking and 
medical imaging data. We also find biases in how humans review code as a
 function of its apparent author, when controlling for code quality. In 
addition to advancing our fundamental understanding of how cognitive 
biases relate to the code review process, the results may inform 
subsequent training and tool design to reduce bias.</p>

						<td>The software development process is a complex human,

software practitioners will not learn from the failures caused by them. 
Although, social factors give rise to high failure rates in software 
development projects they tend to be ignored. Business continues as

 realization of a fully sustainable software development process.This 
paper builds on the master's thesis with the same title completed in

research literature on software development processes addresses (or not)
 the social dimension of sustainability from a holistic point of view. 
The results indicate that the practice of dealing holistically with 
complexity including the social dimension is still underdeveloped.

						<td>Agile software teams are expected to follow a number of 
specific Team Practices (TPs) during each iteration, such as estimating 
the effort ("points") required to complete user stories and coordinating
 the management of the codebase with the delivery of features. For 
software engineering instructors trying to teach such TPs to student 
teams, manually auditing teams if teams are following the TPs and 
improving over time is tedious, time-consuming and error-prone. It is 
even more difficult when those TPs involve two or more tools. For 
example, starting work on a feature in a project-management tool such as
 Pivotal Tracker should usually be followed relatively quickly by the 
creation of a feature branch on GitHub. Merging a feature branch on 
GitHub should usually be followed relatively quickly by deploying the 
new feature to a staging server for customer feedback. Few systems are 
designed specifically to audit such TPs, and existing ones, as far as we
 know, are limited to a single specific tool.We present Bluejay, an 
open-source extensible platform that uses the APIs of multiple tools to 
collect raw data, synthesize it into TP measurements, and present 
dashboards to audit the TPs. A key insight in Bluejay's design is that 
TPs can be expressed in terminology similar to that used for modeling 
and auditing Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance. Bluejay therefore
 builds on mature tools used in that ecosystem and adapts them for 
describing, auditing, and reporting on TPs. Bluejay currently consumes 
data from five different widely-used development tools, and can be 
customized by connecting it to any service with a REST API.Video

			<h2>But is It Exploitable? Exploring How Router Vendors Manage and Patch Security Vulnerabilities in Consumer-Grade Routers</h2>

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>Millions of consumer-grade routers are vulnerable to security 
attacks. Router network attacks are dangerous and infections, presenting
 a serious security threat. They account for 80% of infected devices in 
the market, posing a greater threat than infected IoT devices and 
desktop computers. Routers offer an attractive target of attacks due to 
their gateway function to home networks, internet accessibility, and 
higher likelihood of having vulnerabilities. A major problem with these 
routers is their unpatched and unaddressed security vulnerabilities. 
Reports show that 30% of critical router vulnerabilities discovered in 
2021 have not received any response from vendors. Why? To better 
understand how router vendors manage and patch vulnerabilities in 
consumer-grade routers, and the accompanying challenges, we conducted 30
 semi-structured interviews with professionals in router vendor 
companies selling broadband and retail routers in the UK. We found that 
router professionals prioritize vulnerability patching based on customer
 impact rather than vulnerability severity score. However, they 
experienced obstacles in patching vulnerabilities due to outsourcing 
development to third parties and the inability to support outdated 
models. To address these challenges, they developed workarounds such as 
offering replacement routers and releasing security advisories. However,
 they received pushback from customers who were not technically capable 
or concerned about security. Based on our results, we concluded with 
recommendations to improve security practice in routers.</td>

<p>Millions of consumer-grade routers are vulnerable to security 
attacks. Router network attacks are dangerous and infections, presenting
 a serious security threat. They account for 80% of infected devices in 
the market, posing a greater threat than infected IoT devices and 
desktop computers. Routers offer an attractive target of attacks due to 
their gateway function to home networks, internet accessibility, and 
higher likelihood of having vulnerabilities. A major problem with these 
routers is their unpatched and unaddressed security vulnerabilities. 
Reports show that 30% of critical router vulnerabilities discovered in 
2021 have not received any response from vendors. Why? To better 
understand how router vendors manage and patch vulnerabilities in 
consumer-grade routers, and the accompanying challenges, we conducted 30
 semi-structured interviews with professionals in router vendor 
companies selling broadband and retail routers in the UK. We found that 
router professionals prioritize vulnerability patching based on customer
 impact rather than vulnerability severity score. However, they 
experienced obstacles in patching vulnerabilities due to outsourcing 
development to third parties and the inability to support outdated 
models. To address these challenges, they developed workarounds such as 
offering replacement routers and releasing security advisories. However,
 they received pushback from customers who were not technically capable 
or concerned about security. Based on our results, we concluded with 
recommendations to improve security practice in routers.</p>

						<td>Context: Global Software Engineering (GSE) has become the 
predominant form of software development for global companies and has 
given rise to a demand for students trained in GSE. In response, 
universities are developing courses and curricula around GSE and 
researchers have begun to disseminate studies of these new approaches. 
Problem: GSE differs from most other computer science fields, however, 
in that practice is inseparable from theory. As a result, educators 
looking to create GSE courses face a daunting task: integrating global 
practice into the local classroom. Aim: This study aims to ameliorate 
the very difficult task of teaching GSE by delineating the challenges 
and providing some recommendations for overcoming them. Method: To meet 
our aims we pose two research questions ("When teaching GSE to students 
in Higher Education, what are the (a) challenges, and (b) 
recommendations for addressing them") and then conduct a systematic 
literature review (SLR) to determine the answers to these questions. Our
 SLR follows a carefully designed and validated protocol.Results: We 
found 82 papers that addressed our research questions. Our findings 
indicate that in addition to the challenges posed by GSE in general, 
particular problems arise in educational situations. The majority of 
these challenges fall into the "global distance" category, though 
teamwork challenges and people issues (such as trust) also commonly 
arise. Organizational differences between institutions, differing skill 
sets between students in different locations, and varying cultural work 
norms, for example, all operate within educational settings in quite 
different ways than in professional development teams. Integrating 
cultural training, conducting teamwork exercises to build trust, and 
instructor monitoring of team communication are all examples of 
techniques that have been used successfully by educators according to 
our review Conclusion: Despite the severity of the challenges in GSE 
education, many institutions have successfully developed courses and 
curricula targeting GSE. Indeed, for each of the challenges we have 
identified in the literature there are numerous recommendations for 
overcoming them. Instructors can use the recommendations given in this 
study as a starting point to running successful GSE courses.</td>

						<td>Gig workers, and the products and services they provide, play 
an increasingly ubiquitous role in our daily lives. But despite growing 
evidence suggesting that worker well-being in gig economy platforms have
 become significant societal problems, few studies have investigated 
possible solutions. We take a stride in this direction by engaging 
workers, platform employees, and local regulators in a series of speed 
dating workshops using storyboards based on real-life situations to 
rapidly elicit stakeholder preferences for addressing financial, 
physical, and social issues related to worker well-being. Our results 
reveal that existing public and platformic infrastructures fall short in
 providing workers with resources needed to perform gigs, surfacing a 
need for multi-platform collaborations, technological innovations, as 
well as changes in regulations, labor laws, and the public’s perception 
of gig workers, among others. Drawing from multi-stakeholder findings, 
we discuss these implications for technology, policy, and service as 
well as avenues for collaboration.</td>

<p>Gig workers, and the products and services they provide, play an 
increasingly ubiquitous role in our daily lives. But despite growing 
evidence suggesting that worker well-being in gig economy platforms have
 become significant societal problems, few studies have investigated 
possible solutions. We take a stride in this direction by engaging 
workers, platform employees, and local regulators in a series of speed 
dating workshops using storyboards based on real-life situations to 
rapidly elicit stakeholder preferences for addressing financial, 
physical, and social issues related to worker well-being. Our results 
reveal that existing public and platformic infrastructures fall short in
 providing workers with resources needed to perform gigs, surfacing a 
need for multi-platform collaborations, technological innovations, as 
well as changes in regulations, labor laws, and the public’s perception 
of gig workers, among others. Drawing from multi-stakeholder findings, 
we discuss these implications for technology, policy, and service as 
well as avenues for collaboration.</p>

The vision of a ‘metaverse’ may soon bring a ubiquitous(ly) Augmented

speculative design to explore, question, and problematize consequences

booklets, we co-speculate together with 12 globally dispersed 
participants. Each participant received a custom-made design workbook

integration of their speculative ideas and lived experiences in 3 
overarching themes from which 7 ‘dark’ scenarios caused by UAR were 
formed. The Scenarios are indicative of deceptive design patterns that

could cause unintended consequences. These contributions enable the

we report the experience of a project executed at Federal University of

 In participants' perspective, we applied a survey to collect attitudes,
 which were examined through statistics and content analysis. 
Intersection of results point to the following positive general 
findings: collaborative and joyful environment favors learning, adoption
 of new programming practices fosters participation, and participants 
feel more engaged in problem solving. On the other hand, results 
indicate some issues that shall be addressed: exposure of programming in

						<td>Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are increasingly popular 
to categorize and identify research gaps. Their reliability largely 
depends on the rigour of the attempt to identify, appraise and aggregate
 evidences through coding, i.e. the process of examining and organizing 
the data contained in primary studies in order to answer the research 
questions. Current Qualitative Data Analysis Software (QDAS) lack of a 
common format. This jeopardizes reuse (i.e. difficult to share coding 
data among different tools), evolution (i.e. difficult to turn coding 
data into living documents that evolve as new research is published), 
and replicability (i.e. difficult for third parties to access and query 
coding data). Yet, the result of a recent survey indicates that 71,4% of
 participants (expert SLR reviewers) are ready to share SLR artifacts in
 a common repository. On the road towards open coding-data repositories,
 this work looks into W3C's Open Annotation as the way to RDFized those 
coding data. Benefits include: portability (i.e. W3C's prestige endorses
 the adoption of this standard among tool vendors); webization (i.e. 
coding data becomes URL addressable, hence openly reachable), and data 
linkage (i.e. RDFizing coding data benefit from Web technologies to 
query, draw inferences and easily link this data with external 
vocabularies). This paper rephrases coding practices as annotation 
practices where data is captured as W3C's Open Annotations. Using an 
open annotation repository (i.e. Hypothes.is), the paper illustrates how
 this repository can be populated with coding data. Deployability is 
proven by describing two clients on top of this repository: (1) a write 
client that populates the repository through a color-coding highlighter,
 and (2), a read client that obtains a traditional SLR spreadsheets by

						<td>Given its current ubiquity in banking and other services, 
digital payments should be accessible to all, but neurodiverse 
populations encounter barriers often understudied in research and 
practice. A greater understanding of user needs across the 
neurodivergent spectrum will thus improve universal access. To 
characterize the cognitive accessibility of digital payments, this 
literature review examines 30 scholarly publications, nuancing the 
challenges of online banking for older adults and people with 
neurodiverse needs. Our findings uncover a range of potential design and
 support strategies, including simplifying interfaces with diversified 
cues, raising designer awareness and participant involvement, extending 
third-party support, and leveraging new technological aids. We further 
discuss implications for digital currency design through support for 
user agency, collaborative payments, contextualized inclusive 
approaches, and AI-powered accessible design, hopefully inspiring future
 research on improving web accessibility.</td>

<p>Given its current ubiquity in banking and other services, digital 
payments should be accessible to all, but neurodiverse populations 
encounter barriers often understudied in research and practice. A 
greater understanding of user needs across the neurodivergent spectrum 
will thus improve universal access. To characterize the cognitive 
accessibility of digital payments, this literature review examines 30 
scholarly publications, nuancing the challenges of online banking for 
older adults and people with neurodiverse needs. Our findings uncover a 
range of potential design and support strategies, including simplifying 
interfaces with diversified cues, raising designer awareness and 
participant involvement, extending third-party support, and leveraging 
new technological aids. We further discuss implications for digital 
currency design through support for user agency, collaborative payments,
 contextualized inclusive approaches, and AI-powered accessible design, 
hopefully inspiring future research on improving web accessibility.</p>

						<td>Computational thinking is increasingly introduced at primary 
school level, usually with some form of programming activity. In 
particular, educational robots provide an opportunity for engaging 
students with programming through hands-on experiences. However, primary
 school teachers might not be adequately prepared for teaching computer 
science related topics, and giving feedback to students can often be 
challenging: Besides the content of the feedback (e.g., what problems 
have to be handled), the way the feedback is given is also important, as
 it can lead to negative emotional effects. To support teachers with the
 way of giving feedback on common problems when teaching programming 
with robotics, we conducted a study consisting of seven workshops with 
three third and four fourth grade primary school classes. Within seven 
different activities, the 116 primary school children first programmed 
the Ozobot Evo robot in the pen-and-paper mode and then on a digital 
device. Throughout these activities we collected data on the problems 
the students encountered, the feedback given, and the fun they 
experienced. Our analysis reveals eight categories of problems, which we
 summarise in this paper together with corresponding possible feedback. 
We observed that problems that are urgent or can harm the students’ 
self-efficacy have a negative impact on how enjoyable an activity is 
perceived. While direct instruction significantly decreased the 
experienced fun, hints had a positive effect. Generally, we found 
programming the Ozobot Evo to be encouraging for both girls and boys. To
 support teachers, we discuss ideas for giving encouraging feedback on 
common problems of Ozobot Evo programming activities and how our 
findings transfer to other robots.</td>

						<td>Over the last 20 years, many free/libre and open source 
software (FLOSS) packages have been developed for library and 
information management (LIM) applications. These projects usually 
involve a distributed community of users and developers who jointly 
determine the software's future development. This paper presents the 
results of a web-based survey that examined which factors affect 
participant satisfaction with FLOSS projects. A total of 183 usable 
responses were received from people in 33 countries, representing over 
30 different LIM FLOSS projects. Stepwise hierarchical regression showed
 that five factors (perceived project openness, perceived developer 
communication quality, perceived complexity, extent of participation, 
and perceived product openness) accounted for 44% of the variance in 
satisfaction. Community-oriented characteristics had the most influence,
 suggesting that in a FLOSS context, project participants need to focus 
on community development and support to increase overall satisfaction 
with the project.</td>

<p>Over the last 20 years, many free/libre and open source software 
(FLOSS) packages have been developed for library and information 
management (LIM) applications. These projects usually involve a 
distributed community of users and developers who jointly determine the 
software's future development. This paper presents the results of a 
web-based survey that examined which factors affect participant 
satisfaction with FLOSS projects. A total of 183 usable responses were 
received from people in 33 countries, representing over 30 different LIM
 FLOSS projects. Stepwise hierarchical regression showed that five 
factors (perceived project openness, perceived developer communication 
quality, perceived complexity, extent of participation, and perceived 
product openness) accounted for 44% of the variance in satisfaction. 
Community-oriented characteristics had the most influence, suggesting 
that in a FLOSS context, project participants need to focus on community
 development and support to increase overall satisfaction with the 
project.</p>

						<td>Formal methods and tools have a long history of successful 
applications in the design of safety-critical railway products. However,
 most of the experiences focused on the application of a single method 
at once, and little work has been performed to compare the applicability
 of the different available frameworks to the railway context. As a 
result, companies willing to introduce formal methods in their 
development process have little guidance on the selection of tools that 
could fit their needs. To address this goal, this paper presents a 
comparison between 9 different formal tools, namely Atelier B, CADP, 
FDR4, NuSMV, ProB, Simulink, SPIN, UMC, and UPPAAL SMC. We performed a 
judgment study, involving 17 experts with experience in formal methods 
applied to railways. In the study, part of the experts were required to 
model a railway signaling problem (a moving-block train distancing 
system) with the different tools, and to provide feedback on their 
experience. The information produced was then synthesized, and the 
results were validated by the remaining experts. Based on the outcome of
 this process, we provide a synthesis that describes when to use a 
certain tool, and what are the problems that may be faced by modelers. 
Our experience shows that the different tools serve different purposes, 
and multiple formal methods are required to fully cover the needs of the
 railway system design process.</td>

						<td>For a long time, the teaching of Software Engineering (SE) has
 been carried out in a traditional way without taking into account 
relevant aspects of the student's personality reflected in their 
learning. There is still a lack of research focused on SE that promotes 
adequate teaching methods so that new generations of students and future
 professionals have a humanistic, critical and reflexive formation. A 
novel teaching method called Thinking-based Learning (TBL) was proposed 
to develop effective thinking in students using thinking skills, habits 
of the mind and the metacognition during the teaching of subject 
content. The action research as a methodology to improve their teaching 
practices in education has been seen as a positive change in educational
 practices. The aim of this research was to perform an action research 
based on TBL method to assist in the development of competencies that 
are less attended by traditional methods currently used during the 
teaching and learning process of students in SE. Moreover, a Systematic 
Literature Review (SLR) was conducted to identify gaps in the 
contribution of teaching methods in SE until the present. The data are 
obtained by comparing the competencies achieved with TBL with the 
traditional methods previously used in the discipline, and additionally 
with the data obtained from the SLR. The results indicated that critical
 thinking, autonomy, problem solving and creativity were the most 
developed competencies by students during the course period. We are 
planning to expand the TBL and applying it in other disciplines of the 
same course as well as in other research areas to determine its 
functionality and interdisciplinarity. We hope that this experience with
 TBL will encourage the development of competencies among SE teachers.</td>

						<td>Independently from which software process was selected for a 
company or a project, the selected software process usually cannot be 
applied without any customization. Although the need to tailor a 
software process to specific project requirements seems to be widely 
accepted and unquestioned, the way of doing the tailoring remains 
unclear and is, therefore, often left to the expertise of process 
engineers or project managers. What are the criteria to be applied in 
the tailoring? What are dependencies between different criteria and how 
should certain criteria influence the software process? In this paper we
 investigate concrete tailoring criteria for the tailoring of software 
processes. To this end, we present a collection of 49 tailoring criteria
 as the outcomes of a systematic literature review. We further analyze 
the impact of the discovered tailoring criteria by relating them to a 
set of 20 exemplary tailoring actions, which affect the project-specific
 software process. Our outcomes show that the factors influencing the 
tailoring are well understood, however, the consequences of the criteria
 remain abstract and need to be interpreted on a project-per-project 
basis.</td>

practices. To understand current challenges and barriers in sustainable 
web design, we conducted a qualitative study gathering data from 27 
participants, including practitioners, prospective practitioners, and 
academia in Norway. Our analysis revealed that a lack of knowledge and 
understanding of sustainable web design is the most frequently reported 
challenge. Participants expressed a need for more information and 
specific guidelines on how to implement sustainable practices. Other 
challenges included a lack of prioritization among customers, a lack of 
motivation, comprehension difficulties, and a lack of syllabi in 
academia. The majority of participants ranked sustainability as their 
lowest priority, with accessibility taking the top spot due to current 
regulations in Norway. However, similar challenges were reported in 
implementing web accessibility, where participants expressed 
dissatisfaction with the guidelines.</td>

						<td>Learning management system (LMS) tools are increasingly 
relevant to scaling computing pedagogies. Measuring their utilization 
and impact at scale, however, remains computationally expensive. We 
examine the problem of estimating the utilization of a department-wide 
LMS, and its impact on the design, management and outcomes of Computer 
Science courses. We introduce 'depth-of-use' (DOU): a first-principles, 
resource-specific metric of LMS utilization. We then hypothesis-test the
 relationship between DOU and course attributes like modality (course 
level, mode-of-delivery, third-party app use), participation 
(enrollment, viewership), logistics (teaching support, digital skills 
training) and outcomes (average GPA, DFW rate). Experiments on metadata 
from over 1300 Computer Science courses taught at Virginia Tech between 
2015 and 2019 suggest that our framing of DOU helps identify 
resource-level preferences of micro-cohorts of courses, linked to their 
content, logistics and pedagogies. We discover that, across the Computer
 Science department at Virginia Tech, overall LMS use is consistently 
linked to favorable learning outcomes. We also discover that a complex 
interaction between the needs for scale, ubiquitous access and 
interoperability drives strong LMS utilization, with graduate and 
online-only courses faring highest in their aggregate use of LMS 
services. Finally, we describe two key applications of our analyses. 
One, we demonstrate how DOU can help CS faculty identify the relative 
impact of transition from legacy apps to LMS services. Two, we describe 
how DOU can help instructional designers evaluate and improve their 
design interventions.</td>

						<td>In order to search for content from large video archives, it 
is typically undertaken via keyword queries using predefined metadata 
such as title and other tags. However, it is difficult to use keywords 
to search for specific moments in a video. Video search by examples is a
 desirable approach for this scenario as it allows users to search for 
content using one or more examples without having to specify a keyword. 
However, video search by examples is notoriously challenging, and 
performance is poor. To improve search performance, multiple modalities 
may be considered – image, sound, voice and text, multiple search cues 
could be used to identify more relevant content. This is multimodal 
video search by examples (MVSE), where users can search for content 
using multiple modalities. In this paper, typical end users - BBC 
archivists, programme support staff - are interviewed to identify how 
their search needs can be addressed with the technical capabilities of a
 MVSE tool. Such a search tool will be useful for organisations such as 
the BBC who maintain large collections of video archives and want to 
provide a search tool for their own staff as well as for the public. It 
will also be useful for companies such as Youtube who host videos from 
the public and want to enable video search by examples. The study’s 
objectives explored in this paper were to inform the design and 
development of the UX workflows to gain a broader understanding of what 
opportunities and issues may arise from the proposed prototype tool. 
Results from the thematic analysis was highlighted 4 main themes: 
Opportunities, Time constraints, Activities, and Pain points. Further 
analysis highlighted key areas that should be considered for an 
MVSE-based system, such as scene recognition, face recognition, speed 
issues, and integration..</td>

<p>In order to search for content from large video archives, it is 
typically undertaken via keyword queries using predefined metadata such 
as title and other tags. However, it is difficult to use keywords to 
search for specific moments in a video. Video search by examples is a 
desirable approach for this scenario as it allows users to search for 
content using one or more examples without having to specify a keyword. 
However, video search by examples is notoriously challenging, and 
performance is poor. To improve search performance, multiple modalities 
may be considered – image, sound, voice and text, multiple search cues 
could be used to identify more relevant content. This is multimodal 
video search by examples (MVSE), where users can search for content

						<td>Tinnitus is the perception of sound when no external sound 
source exists. There is currently no cure for tinnitus. Existing 
treatments aim to mitigate tinnitus through Cognitive Behavioural 
Therapy and Sound Therapy. Virtual Reality (VR) has been adopted in 
certain medical fields due to its ability to combine visual and audial 
stimuli, and create immersive, controlled environments. The purpose of 
this research was to develop a novel tinnitus treatment, combining VR 
with existing tinnitus sound therapy, and assess its usability. A user 
study with 18 healthy participants was conducted. Quantitative and 
qualitative analyses garnered largely positive results. Participants 
found the application enjoyable, relaxing, and not stressful. The 
combination of audial and visual elements inside the virtual environment
 delivered a unified audio-visual stimulus and a sense of control of the
 location of the auditory stimulus that would serve as a masker sound in
 future tinnitus masking paradigms. More elaborate environments (beach 
and forest) were perceived as more enjoyable and realistic than a scene 
with minimal content for functionality. The beach scene was perceived as
 the most relaxing set-up, but the forest scene was preferred overall. 
Our results suggest the VR application can be developed into a 
multisensory tinnitus treatment and that future testing of the 
application in a sample of patients with bothersome tinnitus is 
justified. We provide guidelines for future researchers looking to 
create their own VR tinnitus tools.</td>

						<td>Over the years, researchers capitalized on the repetitiveness 
of software changes to automate many software evolution tasks. Despite 
the extraordinary rise in popularity of Python-based ML systems, they do
 not benefit from these advances. Without knowing what are the 
repetitive changes that ML developers make, researchers, tool, and 
library designers miss opportunities for automation, and ML developers 
fail to learn and use best coding practices.To fill the knowledge gap 
and advance the science and tooling in ML software evolution, we 
conducted the first and most fine-grained study on code change patterns 
in a diverse corpus of 1000 top-rated ML systems comprising 58 million 
SLOC. To conduct this study we reuse, adapt, and improve upon the 
state-of-the-art repetitive change mining techniques. Our novel tool, 
R-CPatMiner, mines over 4M commits and constructs 350K fine-grained 
change graphs and detects 28K change patterns. Using thematic analysis, 
we identified 22 pattern groups and we reveal 4 major trends of how ML 
developers change their code. We surveyed 650 ML developers to further 
shed light on these patterns and their applications, and we received a 
15% response rate. We present actionable, empirically-justified 
implications for four audiences: (i) researchers, (ii) tool builders, 
(iii) ML library vendors, and (iv) developers and educators.</td>

<p>Over the years, researchers capitalized on the repetitiveness of 
software changes to automate many software evolution tasks. Despite the 
extraordinary rise in popularity of Python-based ML systems, they do not
 benefit from these advances. Without knowing what are the repetitive 
changes that ML developers make, researchers, tool, and library 
designers miss opportunities for automation, and ML developers fail to 
learn and use best coding practices.To fill the knowledge gap and 
advance the science and tooling in ML software evolution, we conducted 
the first and most fine-grained study on code change patterns in a 
diverse corpus of 1000 top-rated ML systems comprising 58 million SLOC. 
To conduct this study we reuse, adapt, and improve upon the 
state-of-the-art repetitive change mining techniques. Our novel tool, 
R-CPatMiner, mines over 4M commits and constructs 350K fine-grained 
change graphs and detects 28K change patterns. Using thematic analysis, 
we identified 22 pattern groups and we reveal 4 major trends of how ML 
developers change their code. We surveyed 650 ML developers to further 
shed light on these patterns and their applications, and we received a 
15% response rate. We present actionable, empirically-justified 
implications for four audiences: (i) researchers, (ii) tool builders, 
(iii) ML library vendors, and (iv) developers and educators.</p>

						<td>Agile/XP (Extreme Programming) software teams are expected to 
follow a number of specific practices in each iteration, such as 
estimating the effort (”points”) required to complete user stories, 
properly using branches and pull requests to coordinate merging multiple
 contributors’ code, having frequent ”standups” to keep all team members
 in sync, and conducting retrospectives to identify areas of improvement
 for future iterations. We combine two observations in developing a 
methodology and tools to help teams monitor their performance on these 
practices. On the one hand, many Agile practices are increasingly 
supported by web-based tools whose ”data exhaust” can provide insight 
into how closely the teams are following the practices. On the other 
hand, some of the practices can be expressed in terms similar to those 
developed for expressing service level objectives (SLO) in software as a
 service; as an example, a typical SLO for an interactive Web site might
 be ”over any 5-minute window, 99% of requests to the main page must be 
delivered within 200ms” and, analogously, a potential Team Practice (TP)
 for an Agile/XP team might be ”over any 2-week iteration, 75% of 
stories should be ’1-point’ stories”. Following this similarity, we 
adapt a system originally developed for monitoring and visualizing 
service level agreement (SLA) compliance to monitor selected TPs for 
Agile/XP software teams. Specifically, the system consumes and analyzes 
the data exhaust from widely-used tools such as GitHub and Pivotal 
Tracker and provides team(s) and coach(es) a ”dashboard” summarizing the
 teams’ adherence to various practices. As a qualitative initial 
investigation of its usefulness, we deployed it to twenty student teams 
in a four-sprint software engineering project course. We find an 
improvement of the adherence to team practice and a positive students’ 
self-evaluations of their team practices when using the tool, compared 
to previous experiences using an Agile/XP methodology. The demo video is
 located at &lt;a&gt;https://youtu.be/A4xwJMEQh9c&lt;/a&gt; and a

Agile/XP team might be ”over any 2-week iteration, 75% of stories should
 be ’1-point’ stories”. Following this similarity, we adapt a system 
originally developed for monitoring and visualizing service level 
agreement (SLA) compliance to monitor selected TPs for Agile/XP software
 teams. Specifically, the system consumes and analyzes the data exhaust 
from widely-used tools such as GitHub and Pivotal Tracker and provides 
team(s) and coach(es) a ”dashboard” summarizing the teams’ adherence to 
various practices. As a qualitative initial investigation of its 
usefulness, we deployed it to twenty student teams in a four-sprint 
software engineering project course. We find an improvement of the 
adherence to team practice and a positive students’ self-evaluations of 
their team practices when using the tool, compared to previous 
experiences using an Agile/XP methodology. The demo video is located at 
&lt;a&gt;https://youtu.be/A4xwJMEQh9c&lt;/a&gt; and a landing page with a

						<td>Online communities suffer serious newcomer attrition. This 
paper explores whether and how early activity diversity - the degree to 
which a newcomer engages in a wide range of a site's activities in the 
first session - is associated with their longevity. We introduce a 
metric (DSCORE) to characterize early activity diversity in online sites
 and run our analyses on an online community ‘MovieLens’. We find that 
DSCORE is significant both by itself and in conjunction with a measure 
of quantity of activity in predicting longevity. This finding is robust 
to different measures of longevity (aggregate number of sessions and 
attritions after sessions 1, 5, and 10). The immediate implication is an
 effective classifier for identifying users with higher (or lower) 
expected longevity from the first-session activity. We also find DSCORE 
is more useful than a traditional measure of measuring diversity such as
 the Gini-Simpson index. We conclude by discussing how early activity 
diversity may be more broadly effective in supporting design and 
management of online communities.</td>

						<td>Bugs in learners’ programs are often the result of fundamental
 misconceptions. Teachers frequently face the challenge of first having 
to understand such bugs, and then suggest ways to fix them. In order to 
enable teachers to do so effectively and efficiently, it is desirable to
 support them in recognising and fixing bugs. Misconceptions often lead 
to recurring patterns of similar bugs, enabling automated tools to 
provide this support in terms of hints on occurrences of common bug 
patterns. In this paper, we investigate to what extent the hints improve
 the effectiveness and efficiency of teachers in debugging learners’ 
programs using a cohort of 163&amp;nbsp;primary school teachers in 
training, tasked to correct buggy programs, with and without hints on 
bug patterns. Our experiment suggests that automatically generated hints
 can reduce the effort of finding and fixing bugs from 8.66&amp;nbsp;to 
5.24&amp;nbsp;minutes, while increasing the effectiveness by 34% more 
correct solutions. While this improvement is convincing, arguably 
teachers in training might first need to learn debugging “the hard way” 
to not miss the opportunity to learn by relying on tools. We therefore 
investigate whether the use of hints during training affects their 
ability to recognise and fix bugs without hints. Our experiment provides
 no significant evidence that either learning to debug with hints or 
learning to debug “the hard way” leads to better learning effects. 
Overall, this suggests that bug patterns might be a useful concept to 
include in the curriculum for teachers in training, while tool-support 
to recognise these patterns is desirable for teachers in practice.</td>

						<td>A systems-of-systems (SoS) is a class of systems characterized
 by the collaboration among independent constituent systems, each one 
with its own purposes and functionalities and interacting with the 
others aiming to meet common global missions. An essential 
characteristic of any SoS is the so-called emergent behavior, which 
stands for the ability of an SoS of providing new functionalities 
resulted from the runtime collaboration among the constituent systems 
and that are not performed by any of them in isolation. Despite the 
importance of this subject, it is possible to notice that there are some
 lacks related to understanding emergent behavior in SoS, how it 
manifests, and which challenges it imposes to the development of this 
class of systems. This paper presents a systematic mapping study aimed 
to elicit and analyze the state-of-the-art on emergent behavior in SoS. 
By following a systematic procedure of search and selection of primary 
studies, a set of 37 existing studies was analyzed with respect to 
contributions related to emergent behavior in SoS. Obtained results show
 that the studies do not deeply investigate emergent behavior even 
though they mention this characteristic. Grounded on such a discussion, 
this work also presents a research agenda with directions for further 
work on the topic.</td>

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>Context: Secondary studies should be updated from time to time
 to include new evidence to preserve their value. It is recognized that 
one search technique to update secondary studies is forward snowballing 
and that the number of studies identified is dependent on the electronic
 databases selected. However, there is no consensus on what electronic 
database is most appropriate for applying forward snowballing. 
Objective: The main goal of this study is to evaluate the use of 
different electronic databases for applying forward snowballing to 
update secondary studies. Method: Six updates were performed using 
forward snowballing with support from two electronic databases, one 
specific (IEEE Xplore) and the other generic (Google Scholar) and three 
combinations were evaluated to obtain new evidence during secondary 
studies updating: (1) searching using Google Scholar as electronic 
database; (2) searching using IEEE Xplore as electronic database; and 
(3) searching using both, IEEE Xplore and Google Scholar as 
complementary electronic databases. Results: The use of a specific 
electronic database is not indicated for forward snowballing application
 to update SLRs, since many relevant studies may not be identified. 
However, the use of a generic database is sufficient to discover the 
majority of the studies. Conclusions: The emergent contribution of our 
work to the body of knowledge in the SLR field is to add empirical 
evidence regarding the use of different electronic databases to support 
forward snowballing application during secondary studies updates. These 
results should help reviewers when they decide to find evidences to 
update their SLRs.</td>

<p>Context: Secondary studies should be updated from time to time to 
include new evidence to preserve their value. It is recognized that one 
search technique to update secondary studies is forward snowballing and 
that the number of studies identified is dependent on the electronic 
databases selected. However, there is no consensus on what electronic 
database is most appropriate for applying forward snowballing. 
Objective: The main goal of this study is to evaluate the use of 
different electronic databases for applying forward snowballing to 
update secondary studies. Method: Six updates were performed using 
forward snowballing with support from two electronic databases, one 
specific (IEEE Xplore) and the other generic (Google Scholar) and three 
combinations were evaluated to obtain new evidence during secondary 
studies updating: (1) searching using Google Scholar as electronic 
database; (2) searching using IEEE Xplore as electronic database; and 
(3) searching using both, IEEE Xplore and Google Scholar as 
complementary electronic databases. Results: The use of a specific 
electronic database is not indicated for forward snowballing application
 to update SLRs, since many relevant studies may not be identified. 
However, the use of a generic database is sufficient to discover the 
majority of the studies. Conclusions: The emergent contribution of our 
work to the body of knowledge in the SLR field is to add empirical 
evidence regarding the use of different electronic databases to support 
forward snowballing application during secondary studies updates. These 
results should help reviewers when they decide to find evidences to 
update their SLRs.</p>

						<td>This paper examines antecedents and consequences of IT 
professionals' perceptions of job stress within the context of 
assimilating a technological innovation in the workplace. Drawing on 
recent research on issues of gender within the IT profession (Ahuja 
2002; Trauth 2002), as well as on recent studies into gender differences
 in workplace stress (Gardiner &amp;amp; Tiggeman 1999), we develop a 
conceptual framework to understand the phenomenon. We develop hypotheses
 about how the experiences of men and women IT professionals will differ
 in certain ways as they adopt and adapt to using a technological 
innovation. Using a mixed-method study of two firms that were adopting a
 technological innovation, we examine employees' reactions along gender 
lines. We found that perceived compatibility of the changes being 
assimilated was inversely related to employees' perceptions of stress 
for both men and women. While women experienced higher levels of stress 
and being overworked (as we predicted), there were also some 
unanticipated findings. Women IT professionals appeared to be more 
sensitive to the total number of elements in the work environment that 
were changing (total amount of change) as a precursor to stress. In the 
one firm where managers provided more autonomy but less supervision in 
adapting to the new technology, women reported considerably higher 
levels of stress. Based on both our expected and unexpected findings, we
 provide insights for IT practitioners to anticipate and manage 
workplace stress, and we offer future directions for researchers. We 
argue that our recommendations will allow employers to better 
accommodate the needs of a diverse workforce.</td>

amplify other precedents, such as resource shortages, communication

						<td>The process by which norms are developed to become policies, 
the normative decision-making process, is not often explicit to 
stakeholders of Open Source Software (OSS) projects. Understanding the 
normative decision-making process is crucial for members if such 
projects are to evolve and succeed. In this paper, we investigated 
aspects of the normative decision-making processes of OSS development 
through the use of Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs). We compared 
extracted process models with those that are advertised by the Python 
community to evaluate the extent to which those processes overlap. In 
addition, we assess members' involvement and contribution to these 
processes. Our work used structural and behavioral analysis techniques, 
and social network analysis metrics. We found that there were 
differences between the extracted processes and Python's advertised 
process, with the extracted processes being significantly more complex. 
These differences also extended to granular models used for managing 
social and technical aspects of the Python project. Furthermore, some 
key members were largely responsible for PEPs' success. Our extracted 
models could go a far way in helping the Python community to quickly 
understand decision-making processes in Python.</td>

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>The MAPE-K feedback loop has been established as the primary 
reference model for self-adaptive and autonomous systems in domains such
 as autonomous driving, robotics, and Cyber-Physical Systems. At the 
same time, the Human Machine Teaming (HMT) paradigm is designed to 
promote partnerships between humans and autonomous machines. It goes far
 beyond the degree of collaboration expected in human-on-the-loop and 
human-in-the-loop systems and emphasizes interactions, partnership, and 
teamwork between humans and machines. However, while MAPE-K enables 
fully autonomous behavior, it does not explicitly address the 
interactions between humans and machines as intended by HMT. In this 
paper, we present the MAPE-KHMT framework which augments the traditional
 MAPE-K loop with support for HMT. We identify critical human-machine 
teaming factors and describe the infrastructure needed across the 
various phases of the MAPE-K loop in order to effectively support HMT. 
This includes runtime models that are constructed and populated 
dynamically across monitoring, analysis, planning, and execution phases 
to support human-machine partnerships. We illustrate MAPE-KHMT using 
examples from an autonomous multi-UAV emergency response system, and 
present guidelines for integrating HMT into MAPE-K.</td>

<p>The MAPE-K feedback loop has been established as the primary 
reference model for self-adaptive and autonomous systems in domains such
 as autonomous driving, robotics, and Cyber-Physical Systems. At the 
same time, the Human Machine Teaming (HMT) paradigm is designed to 
promote partnerships between humans and autonomous machines. It goes far
 beyond the degree of collaboration expected in human-on-the-loop and 
human-in-the-loop systems and emphasizes interactions, partnership, and 
teamwork between humans and machines. However, while MAPE-K enables 
fully autonomous behavior, it does not explicitly address the 
interactions between humans and machines as intended by HMT. In this 
paper, we present the MAPE-KHMT framework which augments the traditional
 MAPE-K loop with support for HMT. We identify critical human-machine 
teaming factors and describe the infrastructure needed across the 
various phases of the MAPE-K loop in order to effectively support HMT. 
This includes runtime models that are constructed and populated 
dynamically across monitoring, analysis, planning, and execution phases 
to support human-machine partnerships. We illustrate MAPE-KHMT using 
examples from an autonomous multi-UAV emergency response system, and 
present guidelines for integrating HMT into MAPE-K.</p>

Understanding people's attitudes towards and uses of technology is an 
essential aspect of a successful design process. Ethnography is a proven
 method for acquiring this understanding. However, there are challenges 
to incorporating fieldwork, most notably the time factor, considered by 
some as the greatest barrier. This is especially true for many 
technology companies whose turn-around time from concept to design to 
implementation is accelerated. We propose a solution to the dilemma 
between acquiring the benefits of fieldwork with the compressed 
timescales of many technology projects by using focused field trips as a
 method for gaining rich insights into peoples' uses of and attitudes 
towards technologies in real-world settings. In a short amount of time 
(one or two days), field trips sensitize design teams to the priorities 
of stakeholder groups. We outline a systematic approach to incorporating
 field trips as a method for developing rich, qualitative insights using
 rapid qualitative studies.

						<td>Context: Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) projects have
 been used in Software Engineering Education (SEE) to address the need 
for more realistic settings that reduce the gap between software 
engineering (SE) courses and industry needs. A systematic mapping study 
(SMS) performed in 2013 structured the research area on the use of FLOSS
 projects in SEE. Objective: Update the 2013 SMS with studies published 
in the last five years, classifying and summarizing them to discuss 
trends and identify research gaps in the context of the use of FLOSS 
projects in SEE. Method: We retrieved and analyzed a set of 4132 papers 
published from 2013 to 2017, from which 33 papers were selected and 
classified. We analyzed the new results and compared them with those 
from the previous SMS to confirm or discover trends. Results: The 
updated mapping summarizes the studies published in the last five years,
 most of them in conferences. Our analysis confirmed trends previously 
observed for three facets (SE area, curriculum choice and assessment 
type) and discovered new trends for other facets. Conclusion: Studies 
report the use of FLOSS projects in regular, comprehensive SE courses. 
The prevalence of experience reports over solution proposals in the last
 five years may indicate that researchers are more concerned with the 
use and evaluation of existing proposals, although there are still 
opportunities for more empirical work based on sound educational 
research methods.</td>

garbage collector for Rust. To see whether Bronze could make Rust more 
usable, we conducted a randomized controlled trial with volunteers from a
 633–person class, collecting data from 428 students in total. We found 
that for a task that required managing complex aliasing, Bronze users 
were more likely to complete the task in the time available, and those 
who did so required only about a third as much time (4 hours vs. 12 
hours). We found no significant difference in total time, even though 
Bronze users re-did the task without Bronze afterward. Surveys indicated
 that ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes were primary causes of the 
challenges that users faced when using Rust.</td>

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) usually have limited 
resources that prevent them from investing in software-based innovation.
 Sometimes hackathons are used as a resource to crowdsource software for
 NGOs, but often the resulting projects are not usable or not carried 
on. These events are not seen as a good option in Software Engineering 
for social good (i.e., software focused on social change) since they are
 too short to allow an understanding of the social context of the target
 institution. Taking that limitation into account, after performing 6 
months of ethnography to understand the social context of an NGO, by 
identifying user needs and eliciting requirements, we organized an 
inclusive hackathon to address two specific challenges identified in 
that organization. This paper presents an experience report in the 
context of an interdisciplinary project with researchers from the 
Psychology, Design, and Computer Science domains, where the goal is to 
propose and apply an Open Social Innovation process focused on digital 
innovative solutions in the context of an NGO from Brazil that supports 
socially vulnerable people living with HIV/AIDS.Non-governmental 
Organizations (NGOs) often lack the resources to invest in software 
innovation. Hackathons have been used to get software for NGOs, but 
resulting projects are often not useful or continued. These events are 
not seen as the best way to make software for social change, since they 
are too short to understand the context of an NGO. To tackle this 
limitation, researchers in psychology, design, and computer science

						<td>Background: Software organizations increasingly need 
developers with high skills for social interactions. Managers, leaders, 
and academics need to know the human factors influencing the 
individuals, the development team, and the software project activities. 
Despite the increasing number of secondary studies about human factors 
in Software Engineering (SE) and in Agile Software Development (ASD), 
there is no study synthesizing which human factors influence software 
development without a specific perspective from SE or human factor 
thematic. Objective: We aim to summarise human factors and their 
influence on SE development teams and ASD teams. Method: We executed a 
tertiary study. We used thematic analysis to examine the resulting data.
 Results: We found 29 systematic literature reviews and systematic 
mapping studies addressing the human perspective in SE teams. We 
identified 101 human factors and 79 influences grouped in 4 categories 
(Team member, Team, Project, and Organization). Also, we identified 71 
human factors and 60 influences on ASD. The most investigated human 
factors are Communication, Collaboration, Knowledge, and Motivation. 
Conclusions: The identified human factors and their influences can be 
considered most significant by software organizations, researchers, and 
academics in SE practices. Based on our results, practitioners might 
propose activities that enhance human capital behaviors that influence 
individual motivation, agile mindset, team climate, software quality, or
 agile transition in traditional organizations.</td>

						<td>Objectives. Teachers are essential to making computing 
education available to students. A key place to sustainably prepare 
computer science (CS) teachers is in pre-service preparation programs, 
which are often required for certification in the United States. Prior 
work has examined many reasons that people choose to become teachers — 
or choose not to — but little prior work has examined factors that shape
 the pursuit of CS certifications in pre-service in particular. 
Participants. We recruited five teacher candidates who chose to pursue 
CS training in a new pre-service teacher preparation program in the 
United States and five candidates who expressed interest, but ultimately
 opted out. Method. We conducted semi-structured, remote interviews and 
performed a thematic analysis to inductively identify factors that 
influenced candidates’ decisions. Findings. Candidates displayed many 
conceptions of justice that motivated them to teach CS, including 
repairing past wrongs in education, improving representation, and 
expanding literacy. Candidates reported many content knowledge and 
identity factors, including negative experiences in CS education, low CS
 self-efficacy, and a sense of not belonging or being respected in CS 
communities. Capacity for care as novice teachers was another factor: 
candidates feared not being able to care for students’ needs while 
experiencing exhaustion from teaching and training during a pandemic, as
 well as the risks of added course preparation workload from being 
certified in multiple subject areas. Finally, candidates also considered
 opportunity costs like loss of income and job security as factors 
influencing their decisions. Conclusion. These factors highlight the 
importance of surfacing and dismantling implicit barriers, like 
injustice and inequity, and explicit barriers, like funding and 
overwork, so that future teachers feel confident in teaching CS and feel
 able to create equitable, inclusive environments for students to learn.</td>

						<td>HCI and STS researchers have previously described the ethical 
complexity of practice, drawing together aspects of organizational 
complexity, design knowledge, and ethical frameworks. Building on this 
work, we investigate the identity claims and beliefs that impact 
practitioners’ ability to recognize and act upon ethical concerns in a 
range of technology-focused disciplines. In this paper, we report 
results from an interview study with 12 practitioners, identifying and 
describing their identity claims related to ethical awareness and 
action. We conducted a critically-focused thematic analysis to identify 
eight distinct claims representing roles relating to learning, 
educating, following policies, feeling a sense of responsibility, being a
 member of a profession, a translator, an activist, and deliberative. 
Based on our findings, we demonstrate how the claims foreground building
 competence in relation to ethical practice. We highlight the dynamic 
interplay among these claims and point towards implications for identity
 work in socio-technical contexts.</td>

<p>HCI and STS researchers have previously described the ethical 
complexity of practice, drawing together aspects of organizational 
complexity, design knowledge, and ethical frameworks. Building on this 
work, we investigate the identity claims and beliefs that impact 
practitioners’ ability to recognize and act upon ethical concerns in a 
range of technology-focused disciplines. In this paper, we report 
results from an interview study with 12 practitioners, identifying and 
describing their identity claims related to ethical awareness and 
action. We conducted a critically-focused thematic analysis to identify 
eight distinct claims representing roles relating to learning, 
educating, following policies, feeling a sense of responsibility, being a
 member of a profession, a translator, an activist, and deliberative. 
Based on our findings, we demonstrate how the claims foreground building
 competence in relation to ethical practice. We highlight the dynamic 
interplay among these claims and point towards implications for identity
 work in socio-technical contexts.</p>

						<td>Smart Grids are one of the main consequences of the 
digitalization of electrical grid infrastructures that aim to improve 
energy saving and efficiency. Within Smart Grids, different devices and 
electrical substations communicate with each other and need to be 
accessible from the outside. Thus, the need of embracing standards, such
 as those of International Electrotechnical Commission's (IEC), is 
pivotal. IEC 61850 is a standard that covers such a need, and different 
communication protocols have been proposed to fulfill the features that 
the standard proposes. Most proposals focus on heavyweight protocols. 
However, the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) demands 
resource-constrained devices to also participate in IoT networks. In 
this regard, new protocols have been designed and developed, such as the
 Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). The work presented in this 
paper adopts CoAP to provide a full mapping of the functionalities 
specified in IEC 61850 for electrical substations. Furthermore, an 
analytical and critical review of the already proposed mapping 
approaches is provided. Future lines of research towards accelerating

<p>Ethics are essential in DevOps for promoting transparency, trust, 
security, quality, continuous improvement, and user-centricity, as they 
guide individuals and organizations to make responsible choices and 
develop high-quality, secure, and reliable software applications. To 
consider the ethics of the DevOps teams, there is a need to develop 
standards and a code of conduct. The objective of this research work is 
to develop robust guidelines to assist software development 
organizations to consider ethics in the DevOps teams. The empirical 
study will be performed with industry practitioners, and legislation 
experts to explore the important areas and practices that need to be 
followed by the software organizations' work ethics for the DevOps 
teams. We believe the developed robust guidelines will assist the 
organization to follow the work ethics while working in a DevOps 
culture.</p>

						<td>The software industry has been seeing a steady growth 
worldwide. However, the quality of the developed software is tightly 
related to the supply of skilled and capable software developers who are
 able to cope with many challenges and maintain a high level of critical
 thinking during the software development life cycle. Software skills 
are usually gained in upper level software development courses in 
undergraduate IT majors. We have been applying an active learning 
methodology for teaching critical thinking in the classroom. Our college
 is one of the most diverse colleges in the southeast region, which 
makes our classroom a good model of national diversity. In assessing 
critical thinking, the traditional and generic approach is to measure 
skills that are universal and subject-agnostic. In this study, we report
 that the universal skill assessment for software development is 
ineffective in measuring students? growth based on inconclusive testing 
results and a weak test-retest reliability score. We suspect that 
students were unmotivated by several factors, which includes students 
being passive listeners and the subject being unrelated to software. In 
addition, we report a significant potential for developing 
domain-specific critical thinking exercises and testing that could serve
 to train the students and to assess their skills at the same time. We 
would like to emphasize that our conclusion is independent of software 
development, and could be generalized to develop exercises for other

<p>The software industry has been seeing a steady growth worldwide. 
However, the quality of the developed software is tightly related to the
 supply of skilled and capable software developers who are able to cope 
with many challenges and maintain a high level of critical thinking 
during the software development life cycle. Software skills are usually 
gained in upper level software development courses in undergraduate IT 
majors. We have been applying an active learning methodology for 
teaching critical thinking in the classroom. Our college is one of the 
most diverse colleges in the southeast region, which makes our classroom
 a good model of national diversity. In assessing critical thinking, the
 traditional and generic approach is to measure skills that are 
universal and subject-agnostic. In this study, we report that the 
universal skill assessment for software development is ineffective in 
measuring students? growth based on inconclusive testing results and a 
weak test-retest reliability score. We suspect that students were 
unmotivated by several factors, which includes students being passive 
listeners and the subject being unrelated to software. In addition, we 
report a significant potential for developing domain-specific critical 
thinking exercises and testing that could serve to train the students 
and to assess their skills at the same time. We would like to emphasize 
that our conclusion is independent of software development, and could be
 generalized to develop exercises for other subjects.</p>

						<td>Context: The OutSystems Platform is a development environment 
composed of several DSLs, used to specify, quickly build and validate 
web and mobile applications. The DSLs allow users to model different 
perspectives such as interfaces and data models, define custom business 
logic and construct process models. Problem: The DSL for process 
modelling (Business Process Technology (BPT)), has a low adoption rate 
and is perceived as having usability problems hampering its adoption. 
This is problematic given the language maintenance costs. Method: We 
used a combination of interviews, a critical review of BPT using the 
"Physics of Notation" and empirical evaluations of BPT using the System 
Usability Scale (SUS) and the NASA Task Load indeX (TLX), to develop a 
new version of BPT, taking these inputs and Outsystems' engineers 
culture into account. Results: Evaluations conducted with 25 
professional software engineers showed an increase of the semantic 
transparency on the new version, from 31% to 69%, an increase in the 
correctness of responses, from 51% to 89%, an increase in the SUS score,
 from 42.25 to 64.78, and a decrease of the TLX score, from 36.50 to 
20.78. These differences were statistically significant. Conclusions: 
These results suggest the new version of BPT significantly improved the 
developer experience of the previous version. The end users background 
with OutSystems had a relevant impact on the final concrete syntax 
choices and achieved usability indicators.</td>

Adoption of AM requires a suitable organizational environment, with 
significant changes in the employees' behavior and in the working

systematically investigate how to align both OC and AM. In this sense, a
 systematic mapping study (SMS) was conducted to identify studies that 
associate OC in initiatives of AM adoption. This paper presents the 
state-of-the-art about the influence of OC in the adoption of AM. The 
main contribution of this paper is bringing up an overview of the area, 
indicating perspectives of research, and exposing (i) a list of actions 
which have been reported to align OC and AM; (ii) OC factors recognized 
as essential to the successful adoption of AM; and (iii) the perceptions

 ones. Different subsets of the community, characterized by the 
increasing involvement of self-selected volunteers, position themselves 
along the two axes and have different roles in the design and use of the
 generated artefact. We conclude by discussing how this approach can 
help addressing some of the current challenges (i.e. scale, milieu and 
responsibilities) of social innovation in Information Technology.</p>

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>The reuse of artifacts generated throughout the proprietary 
software development has been improved to support and promote 
relationships among vendors, consumers and a central organization that 
maintains the common technological platform. This scenario has been 
investigated as Software Ecosystems (SECO). When the ecosystem is 
centered in a closed platform, it is known as a proprietary SECO. In 
this case, establishing software asset management policies and 
guidelines is a critical aspect for maintaining a sustainable SECO. 
Contributions from actors that are external to the central organization 
should be allowed without exposing internal knowledge and risking the 
ecosystem robustness of the ecosystem. In this context, this study 
investigates asset governance mechanisms in a proprietary SECO by: (1) a
 survey research with 34 participants to capture insights on some 
mechanisms, (2) a set of 8 interviews with a group of managers to 
analyze the most relevant mechanisms; and (3) a correlation analysis 
from the managers’ opinions.</td>

<p>The reuse of artifacts generated throughout the proprietary software 
development has been improved to support and promote relationships among
 vendors, consumers and a central organization that maintains the common
 technological platform. This scenario has been investigated as Software
 Ecosystems (SECO). When the ecosystem is centered in a closed platform,
 it is known as a proprietary SECO. In this case, establishing software 
asset management policies and guidelines is a critical aspect for 
maintaining a sustainable SECO. Contributions from actors that are 
external to the central organization should be allowed without exposing 
internal knowledge and risking the ecosystem robustness of the 
ecosystem. In this context, this study investigates asset governance 
mechanisms in a proprietary SECO by: (1) a survey research with 34 
participants to capture insights on some mechanisms, (2) a set of 8 
interviews with a group of managers to analyze the most relevant 
mechanisms; and (3) a correlation analysis from the managers’ opinions.</p>

factors that influence DX in the context of ecosystems is important for 
keystones that need mechanisms to keep developers accountable for

						<td>Context: Changes in society have made information systems more

system-of-systems (SoS) and system-of-information systems (SoIS). 
Problem: Although SoS offers benefits to organizations, the difficulty 
of IT managers in dealing with information security in these systems can
 leave them vulnerable to threats and impacts caused by cyber-attacks. 
Solution: This study presents mechanisms and technologies that should be
 implemented to ensure that communication between systems is treated 
from the perspective of information security. IS theory: This research 
is based on the General Systems Theory that allows to understand SoS as a
 type of complex system. With the increase in tasks complexity, 
constituent systems collaborate and offer functionalities that could not
 be achieved by them in an isolated form. Method: A systematic mapping 
study (SMS) was carried out to identify how information security 
technologies are used in the context of SoS. Moreover, a survey research
 was conducted to analyze information security aspects in order to 
evaluate the results obtained in the SMS with respect to their 
applicability in industry. Summary of Results: 18 studies were reviewed 
in the SMS and 32 experts participated in the survey. Both studies show 
that stakeholders need to understand vulnerabilities, exposure, and the 
contribution technology makes to prevent cyberattacks and mitigate SoS 
risks. Contributions and Impact in the IS area: This work presents an 
overview of information security in SoS, highlighting related 
technologies so that stakeholders can reflect on cyber threats in 
decision-making processes in organizations, exploring the grand research

 We found that practitioners engaged in bridging work to overcome

lack of resources and incentives for fairness work, practitioners often 
piggybacked on existing requirements (e.g., for privacy assessments) and
 AI development norms (e.g., the use of quantitative evaluation 
metrics), although they worry that these tactics may be fundamentally 
compromised. Finally, we draw attention to the invisible labor that 
practitioners take on as part of this bridging and piggybacking work to 
enact interdisciplinary collaboration for fairness. We close by

men. One reason for this lack of diversity is gender bias. In this 
paper, we study the effects of that bias by using an existing framework 
derived from the gender studies literature. We adapt the four main 
effects proposed in the framework by posing hypotheses about how they 
might manifest on GitHub, then evaluate those hypotheses quantitatively.
 While our results show that effects of gender bias are largely 
invisible on the GitHub platform itself, there are still signals of 
women concentrating their work in fewer places and being more restrained
 in communication than men.</td>

<p>Information workers often struggle to balance their time for a 
variety of activities like focused work, communication, and caring. This
 study analyzes the impact of a commercially available computer-assisted
 time protection intervention that automatically and preemptively 
schedules calendar time for self-determined activities. We analyzed the 
behaviors and self-reports of workers in two naturalistic studies. 
First, we studied 27 workers who were already using Computer-Assisted 
Protected Time (CAP time) and found that they mainly used it for focused
 work. Second, we analyzed the effect of CAP time as a randomized 
intervention on 89 workers who never had CAP time and found that those 
with it self-reported an increase in performance, job resources, and 
immersion. In both studies, workers with CAP time exhibited a 
rearrangement of activities leading to an overall reduction in work 
activity. This study highlights new opportunities for intelligent 
time-management interventions and the importance of protected time at 
work.</p>

						<td>To make images on Twitter and other social media platforms

 need to be added that describe the information contained within the 
image. The lack of alternative text has been an enduring accessibility 
problem since the “alt” attribute was added in HTML 2.0 over 20 years

to turn on a feature that allows descriptions to be added to images in

this paper, we present a study of 1.09 million tweets with images, 
finding that only 0.1% of those tweets included descriptions. In a 
separate analysis of the timelines of 94 blind Twitter users, we found 
that these image tweets included descriptions more often. Even users 
with the feature turned on only write descriptions for about half of the
 images they tweet. To better understand why users provide alternative 
text descriptions (or not), we interviewed 20 Twitter users who have 
written image descriptions. Users did not remember to add alternative 
text, did not have time to add it, or did not know what to include when 
writing the descriptions. Our findings indicate that simply making it 
possible to provide image descriptions is not enough, and reveal future 
directions for automated tools that may support users in writing 
high-quality descriptions.</td>

						<td>Emotion is a key factor in understanding user experiences (UX)
 of interactive systems. An emerging trend within HCI is to apply 
physiological sensors for uncovering emotions. Previous studies rely on 
various sophisticated analysis techniques and specialized knowledge to 
interpret sensor data. While commendable for increasing accuracy at fine
 grained latencies (to detect events within seconds), this can be 
challenging for UX practitioners without specialized knowledge. This 
study contributes in two ways. Firstly by understanding the level of 
sensor accuracy in detecting UX related events. Secondly by applying a 
basic analysis approach where sensor data is interpreted by 21 
non-specialist participants (no previous experience in doing this). 
Their performance is compared to random guessing. Findings show that 
sensor data analyzed by non-specialists are significantly more accurate 
in capturing subjectively reported UX events than random guessing. An 
accuracy level of 60-80% was obtained at granularities within 3.5-11 
seconds of UX related events.</td>

<p>Emotion is a key factor in understanding user experiences (UX) of 
interactive systems. An emerging trend within HCI is to apply 
physiological sensors for uncovering emotions. Previous studies rely on 
various sophisticated analysis techniques and specialized knowledge to 
interpret sensor data. While commendable for increasing accuracy at fine
 grained latencies (to detect events within seconds), this can be 
challenging for UX practitioners without specialized knowledge. This 
study contributes in two ways. Firstly by understanding the level of 
sensor accuracy in detecting UX related events. Secondly by applying a 
basic analysis approach where sensor data is interpreted by 21 
non-specialist participants (no previous experience in doing this). 
Their performance is compared to random guessing. Findings show that 
sensor data analyzed by non-specialists are significantly more accurate 
in capturing subjectively reported UX events than random guessing. An 
accuracy level of 60-80% was obtained at granularities within 3.5-11 
seconds of UX related events.</p>

						<td>The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic prohibited radically the
 collocation and face-to-face interactions of participants in coding 
bootcamps and similar experiences, which are key characteristics that 
help participants to advance technical work. Several specific issues are
 faced and need to be solved when running online coding camps, which can
 achieve the same level of positive outcomes for participants. One of 
such issues is how to keep the same level of fun that participants 
obtained through physical activities and interactions in the 
face-to-face settings. In this paper, we report on our experience and 
insights gained from designing and running a fully remote coding camp 
that exposes high school students to Agile-based Software Engineering 
practices to enhance their ability to develop high-quality software. To 
design the online coding camp, we adapted the face-to-face version of 
the coding camp to keep the same "level of fun", i.e., adaptations aimed
 at increasing communication, engaging participants, and introducing fun
 items to reduce fatigue due to prolonged computer use, while preserving
 the technical curriculum that enables students to attain the learning 
goals originally planned. The comparison with the results of the 
face-to-face coding camp shows that we succeeded in keeping the fun 
alive in the online edition, and the participants of online camp were 
able to produce the results at the same level of quality in terms of 
product and process as in the face-to-face edition. From our experience,
 we synthesize lessons learned, and we sketch some guidelines for 
educators.</td>

more interested in leaving their mark on society at statistically 
significant levels. We also find that OSS4SG contributors evaluate the

						<td>In the past years, machine learning (ML) has become a popular 
approach to support self-adaptation. While ML techniques enable dealing 
with several problems in self-adaptation, such as scalable 
decision-making, they are also subject to inherent challenges. In this 
paper, we focus on one such challenge that is particularly important for
 self-adaptation: ML techniques are designed to deal with a set of 
predefined tasks associated with an operational domain; they have 
problems to deal with new emerging tasks, such as concept shift in input
 data that is used for learning. To tackle this challenge, we present 
lifelong self-adaptation: a novel approach to self-adaptation that 
enhances self-adaptive systems that use ML techniques with a lifelong ML
 layer. The lifelong ML layer tracks the running system and its 
environment, associates this knowledge with the current tasks, 
identifies new tasks based on differentiations, and updates the learning
 models of the self-adaptive system accordingly. We present a reusable 
architecture for lifelong self-adaptation and apply it to the case of 
concept drift caused by unforeseen changes of the input data of a 
learning model that is used for decision-making in self-adaptation. We 
validate lifelong self-adaptation for two types of concept drift using 
two cases.</td>

						<td>Background: In the last two decades Technical Debt (TD) has 
received a considerable amount of attention from software engineering 
research and practice. Recently, a small group of studies suggests that,
 in addition to its technical and economic consequences, TD can affect 
developers' psychological states and morale. However, until now there 
has been a lack of empirical research clarifying such influences. Aims: 
In this study, we aim at taking the first step in filling this gap by 
investigating the potential impacts of TD and its management on 
developers' morale. Method: Drawing from previous literature on morale, 
we decided to explore the influence of TD and its management on three 
dimensions of morale called affective, future/goal, and interpersonal 
antecedents. In so doing, we conducted an exploratory field study and 
collected data from software professionals active in different 
industrial domains through eight qualitative interviews and an online 
survey (n=33). Results: Our results indicate that TD mainly has a 
negative influence on future/goal and affective antecedents of morale. 
This is mainly because the occurrence of TD hinders developers from 
performing their tasks and achieving their goals. TD management, on the 
other hand, has a positive influence on all the three dimensions of 
morale since it is associated with positive feelings and interpersonal 
feedback as well as a sense of progress. Conclusions: According to the 
results of this empirical study, the occurrence of TD reduces 
developers' morale, while its management increases developers' morale.</td>

						<td>The mobile Web is growing as more and more people use a smart 
device to access online services. This rapid growth of mobile Web usage 
is accompanied by the evolution of the mobile Web browser as a fully 
fledged software platform. Due to these two trends, the expectations of 
users in terms of quality of experience (QoE) when browsing the Web on 
their mobile device has increased drastically. As a result, the number 
of studies using measurement-based experiments to investigate the 
factors influencing QoE has grown. However, conducting measurement-based
 experiments on the mobile Web is not a trivial task as it requires a 
significant experience and knowledge about both technical and 
methodological aspects. Unfortunately, there is no systematic study on 
the state of the art of conducting measurement-based experiments on the 
mobile Web that could guide researchers and practitioners when planning 
and performing such experiments. The goal of this work is to build a map
 of existing studies that conduct measurement-based experiments on the 
mobile Web. In total 640 potentially relevant studies are identified. 
After a rigorous selection procedure the set of primary studies consists
 of 28 papers from which we extracted data and gathered insights. 
Specifically, we investigate on (i) which metrics are collected, how 
they are measured, and how they are analysed, (ii) the platforms on 
which the experiments are run, (iii) what subjects are used, and (iv) 
the used tools and environments under which the experiments are run. 
This study benefits researchers and practitioners by presenting common 
techniques, empirical practices, and tools to properly conduct 
measurement-based experiments on the mobile Web.</td>

researches on the most diverse aspects related to microservice-based 
development. However, as it is a relatively new topic, there is still no
 consolidated body of knowledge in the area. Objective. The present work
 intends to investigate the current state of research on microservices 
based on the formulation of six research questions covering fundamental 
aspects, such as: main interest topics and adopted standards, techniques
 and tools have been used and application areas. Method. From four 
digital libraries, 22 secondary studies were selected as a data source, 
which were analyzed and synthesized in the present study following the 
proposed research protocol. Results. Among the main topics of interest 
addressed, we highlight researches related to the applicability of 
microservice architecture, both by industry and academia. Results 
indicated that standards focus on challenges related to communication 
have been the most commonly considered by researchers of the area. 
Finally, the predominance in the use of the Docker container and the 
presence of DevOps practices in the automation of operations are 
noteworthy. Conclusions. The present mapping study points to some 
directions of research based on the identified gaps, such as modeling 
and testing of microservice applications, and addressing security 
aspects. Another promising point to be explored involves the combined 
use of microservice architecture with other related concepts such as 
IoT, smart cities, FOG computing and reactive systems, in order to 
reinforce the use of microservices, as well as creating new solutions

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>The use of smartphones as a technological resource not only 
provides access to information and services but has also improved the 
quality of life of people with visual disabilities, allowing them to be 
more independent in daily activities. The objective of this research was
 to characterize the problems that visually impaired users encounter 
when using mobile applications and relate them to the Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, in order to identify possible gaps 
that make the guidelines insufficient to solve all users' difficulties. 
Mercado Livre was the application selected as object of study and five 
sessions of accessibility evaluation involving visually impaired users 
were carried out. The results demonstrated that many problems 
experienced by users could be related to violations of accessibility 
guidelines of the WCAG 2.0 as long as they were adapted to the context 
of mobile applications. Considering the importance of accessible mobile 
applications, we observed the need to extend studies that support 
developers and designers in achieving better accessibility in user 
interface design for users of assistive technologies, such as screen 
readers.</td>

<p>The use of smartphones as a technological resource not only provides 
access to information and services but has also improved the quality of 
life of people with visual disabilities, allowing them to be more 
independent in daily activities. The objective of this research was to 
characterize the problems that visually impaired users encounter when 
using mobile applications and relate them to the Web Content 
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, in order to identify possible gaps 
that make the guidelines insufficient to solve all users' difficulties. 
Mercado Livre was the application selected as object of study and five 
sessions of accessibility evaluation involving visually impaired users 
were carried out. The results demonstrated that many problems 
experienced by users could be related to violations of accessibility 
guidelines of the WCAG 2.0 as long as they were adapted to the context 
of mobile applications. Considering the importance of accessible mobile 
applications, we observed the need to extend studies that support 
developers and designers in achieving better accessibility in user 
interface design for users of assistive technologies, such as screen 
readers.</p>

						<td>Cancer is the disease that most affects children and young

develop applications to assist patients during the cancer treatment. 
This article presents a systematic mapping of literature to identify 
articles that apply mobile applications to assist patients in cancer 
treatments, in order to show an overview of the literature, identifying 
gaps and research opportunities. The systematic mapping study was 
conducted in six databases including papers from January 2008 to 
December 2018. The initial search resulted in 41,888 papers, of which 31
 were selected after applying the filter criteria. The main results 
obtained are: (1) most papers (61,29%) reported solutions based on 
native mobile applications; (2) majority (67,74%) focused on monitoring 
symptoms and side effects of cancer treatment; (3) most papers (61,29%) 
aimed physical benefits; (4) only two papers (6,45%) provided 
applications to leukemia patients; (5) four papers (12,9%) focused on 
palliative care; and (6) most papers (83,87%) conducted an experiment 
with oncological patients. The results corroborate with the need for 
mobile applications to help individuals in monitoring, psychological 
support, and information regarding about the disease, as well as

programmes in the computing disciplines. While the focus of our work is 
computing the framework is applicable to education more broadly. The 
work presented here draws upon the pioneering curricular document for

the Competency Learning Framework (CoLeaF), providing an internationally
 relevant tool for describing competencies. We argue that this 
competency based approach is well suited for constructing learning 
environments and assists degree programme architects in dealing with the
 challenge of developing, describing and including competencies relevant
 to computer and IT professionals. In this paper we demonstrate how the 
CoLeaF competency framework can be applied in practice, and though a 
series of case studies demonstrate its effectiveness and analytical 
power as a tool for describing and comparing degree programmes in the 
international higher education landscape.</td>

 challenge of developing, describing and including competencies relevant
 to computer and IT professionals. In this paper we demonstrate how the 
CoLeaF competency framework can be applied in practice, and though a 
series of case studies demonstrate its effectiveness and analytical 
power as a tool for describing and comparing degree programmes in the 
international higher education landscape.</p>

						<td>A number of key organizations are sustaining the decades old 
complex legacy systems despite their types of services and operating 
environment. Cloud computing provides numerous processes, tools and 
methods to emphasize upon the pay-as-per-use utility models. The utter 
need to modernize these older systems leads to modernization processes 
involving the vision to leverage the cloud computing benefits. The 
proposed modernization framework includes decision support module 
followed by the elaboration of available modernization approaches. This 
legacy problem is one of the main challenges for cloud computing to deal
 with. When re-architecting and reengineering these legacy systems, 
parallel computing approaches also need to be assessed for resource 
optimization in cloud environments.</td>

						<td>Software engineering involves writing new code or editing 
existing code. Recent efforts have investigated the neural processes 
associated with reading and comprehending code — however, we lack a 
thorough understanding of the human cognitive processes underlying code 
writing. While prose reading and writing have been studied thoroughly, 
that same scrutiny has not been applied to code writing. In this paper, 
we leverage functional brain imaging to investigate neural 
representations of code writing in comparison to prose writing. We 
present the first human study in which participants wrote code and prose
 while undergoing a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) brain 
scan, making use of a full-sized fMRI-safe QWERTY keyboard.We find that 
code writing and prose writing are significantly dissimilar neural 
tasks. While prose writing entails significant left hemisphere activity 
associated with language, code writing involves more activations of the 
right hemisphere, including regions associated with attention control, 
working memory, planning and spatial cognition. These findings are 
unlike existing work in which code and prose comprehension were studied.
 By contrast, we present the first evidence suggesting that code and 
prose writing are quite dissimilar at the neural level.</td>

						<td>A revolution is taking place across Europe and worldwide in 
how we teach our children about computing, in primary and secondary 
school. Out goes ICT and how to use Microsoft Office; in comes coding 
and computer science. Assessment has a crucial role to play in this 
revolution. If teachers use low-quality assessment instruments we will 
end-up teaching the wrong subject; and viceversa. This paper reviews the
 state of the field, and makes concrete, achievable proposals for 
developing shared, high quality assessments for computer science. 
Central to this proposal is the collaborative platform VIVA (the Vilnius
 collaboratively coded and Validated computer science questions/tasks 
for Assess- ment). Two requirements are key to VIVA: 1) support for 
multiple competency frameworks, so that the contributors can meta-tag 
resources with respect to the framework they are most familiar with; and
 2) support for crowdsourcing the validation of each question/task and 
its mapping to competencies. The use of a taxonomy of questions/tasks 
type that has been mapped to computational thinking concepts and to a 
competency framework is proposed. Some seed questions are already 
available in the online platform prototype, and various supporters have 
granted permission to use large questions banks. The design requirements
 of a full implementation of the VIVA platform for a modern and 
effective approach to assessment including support for digital badges, 
are outlined; and some preliminary results from a survey administered to
 the initial contributors to VIVA are presented.</td>

systems. Human-computer interaction scholars have highlighted the role 
of reflexivity while analyzing such data in the case of marginalized 
communities. Drawing on sociomaterial perspectives, we highlight how 
data collection approaches involving lists of search phrases and APIs 
can embed researchers’ positionality, perspectives, and biases within 
the datasets. In this note, we reflect on the data collection approaches
 of two papers that studied the sociohistorically marginalized Bengali 
communities on the question-and-answer site Bengali Quora. We illustrate
 how recommendation systems and data labeling workers can be included in
 the data collection process to democratize and limit bias while 
broadening and contextualizing the trace datasets for research.</td>

<p>Researchers heavily use online platforms for collecting trace data, 
i.e., data capturing user interaction on and with sociotechnical 
systems. Human-computer interaction scholars have highlighted the role 
of reflexivity while analyzing such data in the case of marginalized 
communities. Drawing on sociomaterial perspectives, we highlight how 
data collection approaches involving lists of search phrases and APIs 
can embed researchers’ positionality, perspectives, and biases within 
the datasets. In this note, we reflect on the data collection approaches
 of two papers that studied the sociohistorically marginalized Bengali 
communities on the question-and-answer site Bengali Quora. We illustrate
 how recommendation systems and data labeling workers can be included in
 the data collection process to democratize and limit bias while 
broadening and contextualizing the trace datasets for research.</p>

						<td>[Background] Systematic literature reviews and maps have 
become well-established research methods in software engineering 
research. Of the three commonly suggested and used search methods: 
manual search, database search, or snowball search; systematic 
literature reviews and maps typically employ one or a combination of two
 or three of those as their search strategy. As systematic literature 
reviews and maps raise a claim to result in a representative set of 
relevant papers for a certain area of investigation, it is of importance
 to understand the impact the search strategy has on achieving this 
goal. [Aim] This paper contributes a study to compare all three search 
methods. This study aims at providing evidence as to what advantages and
 disadvantages of these three search methods are. [Method] We conducted 
three systematic literature reviews on the same topic, which affects 
multiple software engineering related disciplines, using different 
search methods, while keeping other parameters like inclusion and 
exclusion criteria consistent among all three reviews. [Results] Our 
results show a similar effectiveness for snowball and database search 
and the highest efficiency for database searches. However, our 
literature reviews led to three barely overlapping sets of papers, which
 in turn led to distinct impressions of the same field. [Conclusion] Our
 results show that the use of a single search method can lead to a set 
of included papers, which misrepresents the research field under 
investigation. Hence, particularly when conducting literature reviews 
that affect different software engineering sub-disciplines and related 
disciplines, researchers should not just rely on the single most 
effective and/or efficient search method.</td>

 what happens (processes) and what is produced (outcomes), and critical

<p>The number of hackathon events worldwide has nearly quadrupled in the
 last five years. Despite exponential growth across diverse industries 
and increasing interest across academic disciplines, our integrated 
understanding of the phenomena of hackathons is limited. We conduct the 
first multidisciplinary literature review of publications from 1999 to 
2022 to understand the conceptualization of the phenomena over time. We 
find that hackathon research can be categorized into 4 core areas

complex tasks such as environmental data collection, search and rescue 
operations, and discovery of natural resources. By providing individual 
agents with learning capabilities, CSAS can cope with challenges related
 to distributed sensing and decision-making and operate in uncertain 
environments. This unique characteristic of CSAS enables the collective 
to exhibit robust behaviour while achieving system-wide and

applications, selecting suitable learning models and techniques remains a
 significant challenge that is heavily influenced by expert knowledge. 
We address this gap by performing a multifaceted analysis of existing

this analysis, we introduce a 3D framework that illustrates the learning
 aspects of CSAS considering the dimensions of autonomy, knowledge 
access, and behaviour, and facilitates the selection of learning 
techniques and models. Finally, using example applications from this 
analysis, we derive open challenges and highlight the need for research 
on collaborative, resilient and privacy-aware mechanisms for CSAS.</td>

						<td>Software Ecosystem (SECO) comprises third-party developers 
cooperating and competing when contributing to a platform provided by a 
central organization (keystone). A keystone has invested in a Developer 
Relations (DevRel) internal team as a global business strategy to 
attract and engage a critical mass of third-party developers in 
producing and evolving contributions. For this reason, the DevRel team 
should promote social relationships among SECO actors and synergy among 
keystone' goals and developers' expectations. It can help to establish 
and sustain a competitive value creation network (VCN) within a SECO 
that must survive to inherit changes. However, it is still a challenge 
the way DevRel team can act on a SECO to better engage the developers' 
communities aiming to establish a robust VCN. In this paper, we advance 
on investigating the perceptions of 31 DevRel practitioners from large, 
medium and small-size companies based on seven countries about value 
creation in DevRel. We found 55 elements of value creation distributed 
in retention, efficiency, innovation, and complementarity. Based on our 
analysis, we contribute with a set of seven insights (feedback loop, 
loyalty program, roadmap enhancement, technical training, processes 
restructuring, innovative products, cost reducing) and a DevRel VCN that
 involves elements, suppliers and consumers. It fosters a common 
perspective for DevRel practitioners, keystones and researchers for 
designing strategies and a research roadmap.</td>

<p>Software Ecosystem (SECO) comprises third-party developers 
cooperating and competing when contributing to a platform provided by a 
central organization (keystone). A keystone has invested in a Developer 
Relations (DevRel) internal team as a global business strategy to 
attract and engage a critical mass of third-party developers in 
producing and evolving contributions. For this reason, the DevRel team 
should promote social relationships among SECO actors and synergy among 
keystone' goals and developers' expectations. It can help to establish 
and sustain a competitive value creation network (VCN) within a SECO 
that must survive to inherit changes. However, it is still a challenge 
the way DevRel team can act on a SECO to better engage the developers' 
communities aiming to establish a robust VCN. In this paper, we advance 
on investigating the perceptions of 31 DevRel practitioners from large, 
medium and small-size companies based on seven countries about value 
creation in DevRel. We found 55 elements of value creation distributed 
in retention, efficiency, innovation, and complementarity. Based on our 
analysis, we contribute with a set of seven insights (feedback loop, 
loyalty program, roadmap enhancement, technical training, processes 
restructuring, innovative products, cost reducing) and a DevRel VCN that
 involves elements, suppliers and consumers. It fosters a common 
perspective for DevRel practitioners, keystones and researchers for 
designing strategies and a research roadmap.</p>

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>Background: Modern code review is expected to facilitate 
knowledge sharing: All relevant information, the collective expertise, 
and meta-information around the code change and its context become 
evident, transparent, and explicit in the corresponding code review 
discussion. The discussion participants can leverage this information in
 the following code reviews; the information diffuses through the 
communication network that emerges from code review. Traditional 
time-aggregated graphs fall short in rendering information diffusion as 
those models ignore the temporal order of the information exchange: 
Information can only be passed on if it is available in the first place.
 Aim: This manuscript presents a novel model based on time-varying 
hypergraphs for rendering information diffusion that overcomes the 
inherent limitations of traditional, time-aggregated graph-based models.
 Method: In an in-silico experiment, we simulate an information 
diffusion within the internal code review at Microsoft and show the 
empirical impact of time on a key characteristic of information 
diffusion: the number of reachable participants. Results: 
Time-aggregation significantly overestimates the paths of information 
diffusion available in communication networks and, thus, is neither 
precise nor accurate for modelling and measuring the spread of 
information within communication networks that emerge from code review. 
Conclusion: Our model overcomes the inherent limitations of traditional,
 static or time-aggregated, graph-based communication models and sheds 
the first light on information diffusion through code review. We believe
 that our model can serve as a foundation for understanding, measuring, 
managing, and improving knowledge sharing in code review in particular 
and information diffusion in software engineering in general.</td>

						<td>Without newcomers, open source software (OSS) projects are 
hardly sustainable. Yet, newcomers face a steep learning curve during 
OSS onboarding in which they must overcome a multitude of technical, 
social, and knowledge barriers. To ease the onboarding process, OSS 
communities are utilizing mentoring, task recommendation (e.g., "good 
first issues"), and engagement programs (e.g., Google Summer of Code). 
However, newcomers must first cultivate their motivation for OSS 
contribution and learn the necessary preliminaries before they can take 
advantage of these mechanisms. We believe this gap can be filled by a 
dedicated, practice-oriented OSS onboarding course. In this paper, we 
present our experience of teaching an OSS onboarding course at Peking 
University. The course contains a series of lectures, labs, and invited 
talks to prepare students with the required skills and motivate them to 
contribute to OSS. In addition, students are required to complete a 
semester-long course project in which they plan and make actual 
contributions to OSS projects. They can either contribute to some 
recommended OSS projects with dedicated mentors, or contribute to any 
OSS project they prefer. Finally, 16 out of the 19 enrolled students 
have successfully contributed to OSS projects, and five have retained. 
However, the onboarding trajectories, final contributions, and retention
 outcomes differ vastly between the two groups of students with 
different course project choices, yielding lessons for software 
engineering education.</td>

<p>The Family Archive device is an interactive multi-touch tabletop 
technology with integrated capture facility for the archiving of 
sentimental artefacts and memorabilia. It was developed as a technology 
probe to help us open up current family archiving practices and to 
explore family archiving in situ. We detail the deployment and study of 
three of these devices in family homes and discuss how deploying a new, 
potentially disruptive, technology can foreground the social relations 
and organizing systems in domestic life. This in turn facilitates 
critical reflection on technology design.</p>

						<td>Deploying machine learning (ML) models to production with the 
same level of rigor and automation as traditional software systems has 
shown itself to be a non-trivial task, requiring extra care and 
infrastructure to deal with the additional challenges. Although many 
studies focus on adapting ML software engineering (SE) approaches and 
techniques, few studies have summarized the status and challenges of 
operationalizing ML models. Model operationalization encompasses all 
steps after model training and evaluation, including packaging the model
 in a format appropriate for deployment, publishing to a model registry 
or storage, integrating the model into a broader software system, 
serving, and monitoring. This study is the first systematic literature 
review investigating the techniques, tools, and infrastructures to 
operationalize ML models. After reviewing 24 primary studies, the 
results show that there are a number of tools for most use cases to 
operationalize ML models and cloud deployment in particular. The review 
also revealed several research opportunities, such as dynamic 
model-switching, continuous model-monitoring, and efficient edge ML 
deployments.</td>

						<td>This paper examines literature in the twin domains of 
participatory interactive systems design and participatory approaches to
 international development. As interactive systems are increasingly 
promoted as a possible means of achieving international development 
goals, designers generally agree that participatory design approaches 
should be applied. However, review of the literature reveals that these 
two different traditions have more complex relationships, and questions 
must be asked about: the aims of participation, the forms of 
participation that are being advocated, and the skills and strategies 
required of practitioners. The findings suggest that successful 
integration of participatory interactive systems design into development
 will require careful reflection on the nature of development and the 
approaches adopted.</td>

<p>This paper examines literature in the twin domains of participatory 
interactive systems design and participatory approaches to international
 development. As interactive systems are increasingly promoted as a 
possible means of achieving international development goals, designers 
generally agree that participatory design approaches should be applied. 
However, review of the literature reveals that these two different 
traditions have more complex relationships, and questions must be asked 
about: the aims of participation, the forms of participation that are 
being advocated, and the skills and strategies required of 
practitioners. The findings suggest that successful integration of 
participatory interactive systems design into development will require 
careful reflection on the nature of development and the approaches 
adopted.</p>

						<td>This case study explores the use of an existing data-driven 
storytelling method, called data comic, within a co-design process, to 
improve the sense-making of data. Data can often support a co-design 
process by providing additional insight towards a problem that is being 
solved. A large number of methods are available to facilitate different 
aspects of a co-design process, but when it comes to embedding curated 
data, alternatives are limited. Not everyone has the expertise to 
understand raw data and co-design scenarios are typically time-limited 
meaning that learning new data skills is not the focus. Therefore, 
appropriate data curation can help to bring data into a design process 
while reducing time spent on data manipulation or upskilling. At the 
same time, it is important that participants are encouraged to think 
critically about the data and not simply accept a pre-determined 
viewpoint. We have adapted an existing technique called Data Comic for 
curating data for use in a co-design situation by turning the comic 
panels into a card game so that they can be used interactively and 
collaboratively. In this paper, we describe and reflect on its use 
within a workshop with participants who were mostly teenagers. We led 
them through a process of engaging with curated data to make sense of 
water pollution in a Finnish lake since the 1970s and raise awareness 
towards environmental pollution. We present our results from the 
participant's feedback and workshop to reflect on how data comics played
 a role in sense-making.</td>

						<td>Model transformation languages are special-purpose languages, 
which are designed to define transformations as comfortably as possible,
 i.e., often in a declarative way. Typically, developers create their 
transformations based on small input models which systematically cover 
the language of the input models. This makes it difficult for the 
developers to estimate how the transformations would perform for a large
 and diverse set of input models.Hence, developers would benefit from an
 approach for predicting the performance of model transformations based 
on just abstract characteristics of input models. Regression approaches 
based on machine learning lend themselves well to such predictions. 
However, it is currently unknown, whether and which regression approach 
is suitable in this context as well as how a model should be abstractly 
characterized for this purpose.We conducted several experiments to 
analyze how well different machine learning methods predict the 
execution time of model transformations defined in the Atlas 
Transformation Language (ATL) transformations for distinct sets of model
 characteristics. As possible methods, we have investigated linear 
regression, random forests and support vector regression using a radial 
basis function kernel.The results of our experiments show that support 
vector regression is the best choice in terms of usability and 
prediction accuracy for the model transformation modules covered in our 
experiments and is thus suited for a prediction approach. In addition, 
simple model characterizations based only on the number of model 
elements, the number of references, and the number of attributes are a 
suitable way to easily describe a model and to achieve decent prediction
 accuracy.</td>

<p>Model transformation languages are special-purpose languages, which 
are designed to define transformations as comfortably as possible, i.e.,
 often in a declarative way. Typically, developers create their 
transformations based on small input models which systematically cover 
the language of the input models. This makes it difficult for the 
developers to estimate how the transformations would perform for a large
 and diverse set of input models.Hence, developers would benefit from an
 approach for predicting the performance of model transformations based 
on just abstract characteristics of input models. Regression approaches 
based on machine learning lend themselves well to such predictions. 
However, it is currently unknown, whether and which regression approach 
is suitable in this context as well as how a model should be abstractly 
characterized for this purpose.We conducted several experiments to 
analyze how well different machine learning methods predict the 
execution time of model transformations defined in the Atlas 
Transformation Language (ATL) transformations for distinct sets of model
 characteristics. As possible methods, we have investigated linear 
regression, random forests and support vector regression using a radial 
basis function kernel.The results of our experiments show that support 
vector regression is the best choice in terms of usability and 
prediction accuracy for the model transformation modules covered in our 
experiments and is thus suited for a prediction approach. In addition, 
simple model characterizations based only on the number of model 
elements, the number of references, and the number of attributes are a 
suitable way to easily describe a model and to achieve decent prediction
 accuracy.</p>

						<td>Since several data protection regulations were enacted in the 
last couple of years, we aimed to investigate the state-of-the-art of 
Privacy by Design in Software Engineering. An early Systematic Mapping 
Study investigated that before the General Data Protection Regulation 
(GDPR) came into force. Initial scoping suggested the existence of 
several new studies suitable for inclusion, so we performed an update to
 verify what has changed in the area. From the 68 selected papers, we 
found that (a) professional practice has gained attention with software 
developers at the centre; (b) GDPR has become a trend; (c) much of the 
research is regulation-centric and a more user-centric view is missing 
and (d) there is still a need for validation in industrial settings.</td>

						<td>Our work builds knowledge on gender-neutral hackathons in 
educational context. Hackathon itself is an intensive project-based 
event, requiring participants to make results in a short timeframe, 
which stimulates creative thinking, knowledge sharing, and overall 
learning. This has made hackathons popular in an educational context. As
 a hackathon event often implies software design, the introduction of 
hackathon practices would be especially beneficial for Software 
Engineering education. The question is how to attract a diverse student 
audience to enroll in these hackathon events and hackathon enhanced 
courses. Historically, hackathons attract fewer females than males and 
show gender balance issues. Even though there are positive examples of 
female-inclusive events, there is a risk that by focusing on women's 
interests, the hackathon designers could end up discouraging the male 
audience. It was found that men e.g., tend to reject feminine products 
and occupations as they experience social pressure regarding what is 
acceptable for them. Thus, it would be reasonable to focus on the 
hackathon's gender-neutrality rather than on female inclusivity. This 
research provides practices to implement hackathon courses 
gender-neutrally. We also discuss pros and cons of different approaches.</td>

<p>Our work builds knowledge on gender-neutral hackathons in educational
 context. Hackathon itself is an intensive project-based event, 
requiring participants to make results in a short timeframe, which 
stimulates creative thinking, knowledge sharing, and overall learning. 
This has made hackathons popular in an educational context. As a 
hackathon event often implies software design, the introduction of 
hackathon practices would be especially beneficial for Software 
Engineering education. The question is how to attract a diverse student 
audience to enroll in these hackathon events and hackathon enhanced 
courses. Historically, hackathons attract fewer females than males and 
show gender balance issues. Even though there are positive examples of 
female-inclusive events, there is a risk that by focusing on women's 
interests, the hackathon designers could end up discouraging the male 
audience. It was found that men e.g., tend to reject feminine products 
and occupations as they experience social pressure regarding what is 
acceptable for them. Thus, it would be reasonable to focus on the 
hackathon's gender-neutrality rather than on female inclusivity. This 
research provides practices to implement hackathon courses 
gender-neutrally. We also discuss pros and cons of different approaches.</p>

exploring how design can encourage smartphone accountability in family 
home settings. We developed and deployed three provotypes with seven 
families via a Research through Design study intended to encourage 
reflections on ubiquitous and routinised smartphone usage. The 
provotypes progressively explore ways of making smartphone use visible 
by facilitating individualised accountability, competitive 
accountability, and collective accountability. We present insights into 
how these provotypes shaped family practices based on a qualitative 
study with 26 participants. We found that, by emphasising different 
forms of shared accountability, the provotypes reduced smartphone use, 
which in turn fostered family intimacy and togetherness, rooted in 
meanings of caring and sharing. Finally, we discuss our study’s 
implications for how provotypes can help explore forms of accountability
 in practices involving sustainable technology use within the home.</td>

						<td>Organizations that produce software cooperatively and 
competitively to satisfy customer needs give more attention in 
relationships among several actors (e.g., providers, developers, and IT 
managers) to build the value creation network called Software Ecosystem 
(SECO). As a type of SECO, proprietary SECO concerns data concentrated 
on a platform with contributions protected by intellectual property. The
 technological platform that supports the business initiatives is 
developed using different technologies with dozens of integration 
points, promoting a network of dependencies and architectural 
complexities. Some studies show that systems downtime (incidents) causes
 major image and financial upheavals for organizations. To mitigate the 
risks of incidents, the IT management team should implement strategies 
based on governance mechanisms to sustain the platform. Our work aims to
 develop and evaluate a process-based approach (PSECO-IM) for incident 
management to support the IT management team in the governance of a 
technology platform architecture in a proprietary SECO. We also 
addressed some of the identified challenges of quality in proprietary 
SECO, such as standardized software processes, knowledge management, and
 governance strategies. As a final result, we got positive feedback on 
the relevance of the tool in improving governance strategies related to 
incident management by the organization’s practitioners. We argue that 
this work is appropriate for the Software Quality area since it covers 
studies on three pillars: people, process, and technology, such as tacit
 knowledge, low-quality software, governance, incident management, and 
proprietary SECO.</td>

						<td>System-of-Systems (SoS) have been considered the new trend of 
software systems for several reasons, such as the advancement of 
computer technology and the increasing complexity and size of the 
systems. The concept of SoS has the central idea of a set of 
operationally independent software systems that collaborate together to 
compose a larger and more complex system. For SoS, several quality 
attributes are critical due to its characteristics and domain 
constraints. However, the existent quality models were not conceived to 
address SoS. Therefore, the identification of quality models that can 
address the quality attributes for SoS needs to be investigated. So, the
 purpose of this work is to identify the most common quality attributes 
in SoS context and analyze their coverage by the well established 
ISO/IEC 25010 quality model. As a result, we have identified that the 
current quality models cannot address the complex interdependencies 
between SoS quality attributes due its dynamic nature.</td>

<p>System-of-Systems (SoS) have been considered the new trend of 
software systems for several reasons, such as the advancement of 
computer technology and the increasing complexity and size of the 
systems. The concept of SoS has the central idea of a set of 
operationally independent software systems that collaborate together to 
compose a larger and more complex system. For SoS, several quality 
attributes are critical due to its characteristics and domain 
constraints. However, the existent quality models were not conceived to 
address SoS. Therefore, the identification of quality models that can 
address the quality attributes for SoS needs to be investigated. So, the
 purpose of this work is to identify the most common quality attributes 
in SoS context and analyze their coverage by the well established 
ISO/IEC 25010 quality model. As a result, we have identified that the 
current quality models cannot address the complex interdependencies 
between SoS quality attributes due its dynamic nature.</p>

<p>&lt;u&gt;Background.&lt;/u&gt; Even though the amount of researches 
related to the behavior of software development teams has significantly 
increased in recent years, researches focusing on motivation as an 
alternative to lead software projects to success are still 
rare.&lt;u&gt;Objective/Method:&lt;/u&gt; This article describes a 
survey conducted to identify the relative importance of some factors 
that affect the motivation of software engineers at work. The conceptual
 underpinnings of human motivation used in the research are the 
Expectancy Theory and the Motivation-Hygiene 
Theory.&lt;u&gt;Results/Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt; In the study, a 
cross-sectional survey was conducted involving 176 software engineers 
employed at 20 software firms from the State of Pernambuco, Brazil. Data
 collected with the survey revealed not only the order in which the set 
of motivators influences the software engineers' motivation and other 
peripheral findings, but also served as a basis to design three 
motivation strategies for software engineering teams.</p>

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>Context: Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) replication 
researchers need to store and manipulate experimental data for several 
purposes, in particular analysis and reporting. Current research needs 
call for sharing and preservation of experimental data as well. In a 
previous work, we analyzed Replication Data Management (RDM) needs. A 
novel concept, called Experimental Ecosystem, was proposed to solve 
current deficiencies in RDM approaches. The empirical ecosystem provides
 replication researchers with a common framework that integrates 
transparently local heterogeneous data sources. A typical situation 
where the Empirical Ecosystem is applicable, is when several members of a
 research group, or several research groups collaborating together, need
 to share and access each other experimental results. However, to be 
able to apply the Empirical Ecosystem concept and deliver all promised 
benefits, it is necessary to analyze the software architectures and 
tools that can properly support it.Goal: Identify the most appropriate 
technologies for the implementation of the Empirical Ecosystem 
concept.Method: For the purpose of technology identification, four 
features are particularly relevant: Volume of data, architecture, data 
semantics and manipulation facilities. Those features were surveyed in 
repositories and data sharing and preservation tools used in the 
sciences by means of a systematic literature review.Results: 17 sharing 
and preservation tools reported in the literature were identified. The 
fields of Genomics and Proteomics, and secondarily Biology, stand out. 
Given the importance of those disciplines in today's science and 
economy, it would not be surprising that many other proprietary tools 
would have gone unnoticed. Regarding repositories, there are hundreds 
available (either publicly or restricted access) in the Internet. 
Typically, they aim at benchmarking, or reanalysis and synthesis of 
existing empirical studies. Most repositories (both in number and 
importance) belong to the "hard sciences" (e.g. biology, physics, etc.),
 but virtually every research area is represented, including ESE.Most 
tools and repositories use relational databases for data storage, with 
very little exceptions. When the amount of stored data is very high 
(e.g. Genomics), relational databases are being substituted by big data 
management infrastructures such as Apache™ Hadoop®. Relational databases
 are also used when data are distributed. Global conceptual models 
guarantee the interoperability among different data sources. When data 
are heterogeneous, the situation is more complex. Standard conceptual 
schemas may not be useful, because the semantics of the local data do 
not necessarily agree the meaning assigned to the global schema. 
Likewise, large parts of the conceptual schema may not be applicable to 
local data sources, and the links among local models may not be easily 
defined. The current trend is abandoning classical conceptual schemas 
(e.g. entity-relationship) and standardize the vocabulary of the domain 
using ontologies.Manipulation facilities are almost invariably offered 
using web portals. In some cases, repositories provide web services to 
give access to data for e-science purposes.Conclusions: The review of 
the technologies used for the implementation of repositories and sharing
 and preservation tools in the sciences shows that common, well-known 
technologies (particularly, relational databases) can be used for the 
implementation of the Empirical Ecosystem concept. The only exception is
 the semantic integration of local models. Instead of comprehensive, 
global conceptual schemas, ontologies are being increasingly used for 
semantic integration.</td>

<p>Context: Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) replication researchers
 need to store and manipulate experimental data for several purposes, in
 particular analysis and reporting. Current research needs call for 
sharing and preservation of experimental data as well. In a previous 
work, we analyzed Replication Data Management (RDM) needs. A novel 
concept, called Experimental Ecosystem, was proposed to solve current 
deficiencies in RDM approaches. The empirical ecosystem provides 
replication researchers with a common framework that integrates 
transparently local heterogeneous data sources. A typical situation 
where the Empirical Ecosystem is applicable, is when several members of a
 research group, or several research groups collaborating together, need
 to share and access each other experimental results. However, to be 
able to apply the Empirical Ecosystem concept and deliver all promised 
benefits, it is necessary to analyze the software architectures and 
tools that can properly support it.Goal: Identify the most appropriate 
technologies for the implementation of the Empirical Ecosystem 
concept.Method: For the purpose of technology identification, four 
features are particularly relevant: Volume of data, architecture, data 
semantics and manipulation facilities. Those features were surveyed in 
repositories and data sharing and preservation tools used in the 
sciences by means of a systematic literature review.Results: 17 sharing 
and preservation tools reported in the literature were identified. The 
fields of Genomics and Proteomics, and secondarily Biology, stand out. 
Given the importance of those disciplines in today's science and 
economy, it would not be surprising that many other proprietary tools 
would have gone unnoticed. Regarding repositories, there are hundreds 
available (either publicly or restricted access) in the Internet. 
Typically, they aim at benchmarking, or reanalysis and synthesis of 
existing empirical studies. Most repositories (both in number and 
importance) belong to the "hard sciences" (e.g. biology, physics, etc.),
 but virtually every research area is represented, including ESE.Most 
tools and repositories use relational databases for data storage, with 
very little exceptions. When the amount of stored data is very high 
(e.g. Genomics), relational databases are being substituted by big data 
management infrastructures such as Apache™ Hadoop®. Relational databases
 are also used when data are distributed. Global conceptual models 
guarantee the interoperability among different data sources. When data 
are heterogeneous, the situation is more complex. Standard conceptual 
schemas may not be useful, because the semantics of the local data do 
not necessarily agree the meaning assigned to the global schema. 
Likewise, large parts of the conceptual schema may not be applicable to 
local data sources, and the links among local models may not be easily 
defined. The current trend is abandoning classical conceptual schemas 
(e.g. entity-relationship) and standardize the vocabulary of the domain 
using ontologies.Manipulation facilities are almost invariably offered 
using web portals. In some cases, repositories provide web services to 
give access to data for e-science purposes.Conclusions: The review of 
the technologies used for the implementation of repositories and sharing
 and preservation tools in the sciences shows that common, well-known 
technologies (particularly, relational databases) can be used for the 
implementation of the Empirical Ecosystem concept. The only exception is
 the semantic integration of local models. Instead of comprehensive, 
global conceptual schemas, ontologies are being increasingly used for 
semantic integration.</p>

						<td>Computers are used for various purposes and frequent context 
switch is inevitable. In this setting, retrieving the documents, files, 
and web pages that have been used for a task can be a challenge. While 
modern applications provide a history of recent documents for users to 
resume work, this is not sufficient to retrieve all the digital 
resources relevant to a given primary document. The histories currently 
available - file names, web page titles, or URLs - does not take into 
account the complex dependencies that exist among resources across 
applications. To address this problem, we tested the idea of using a 
visual history of a computer screen to retrieve digital resources within
 a few days through the development of ScreenTrack. ScreenTrack is 
software that captures screenshots of a computer at regular intervals. 
It then generates a time-lapse video from the captured screenshots and 
lets users retrieve a recently opened document or web page from a 
screenshot that they recognize from its visuals. Through a controlled 
user study, it was found that participants were able to retrieve 
requested information more quickly with ScreenTrack than under the 
control condition. A follow-up study showed that the participants used 
ScreenTrack to retrieve previously used resources, in order to resume 
interrupted tasks.</td>

<p>Computers are used for various purposes and frequent context switch 
is inevitable. In this setting, retrieving the documents, files, and web
 pages that have been used for a task can be a challenge. While modern 
applications provide a history of recent documents for users to resume 
work, this is not sufficient to retrieve all the digital resources 
relevant to a given primary document. The histories currently available -
 file names, web page titles, or URLs - does not take into account the 
complex dependencies that exist among resources across applications. To 
address this problem, we tested the idea of using a visual history of a 
computer screen to retrieve digital resources within a few days through 
the development of ScreenTrack. ScreenTrack is software that captures 
screenshots of a computer at regular intervals. It then generates a 
time-lapse video from the captured screenshots and lets users retrieve a
 recently opened document or web page from a screenshot that they 
recognize from its visuals. Through a controlled user study, it was 
found that participants were able to retrieve requested information more
 quickly with ScreenTrack than under the control condition. A follow-up 
study showed that the participants used ScreenTrack to retrieve 
previously used resources, in order to resume interrupted tasks.</p>

			<h2>Sensitivity of Results to Different Data Quality Meta-Data Criteria in the Sample Selection of Projects from the ISBSG Dataset</h2>

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>Background: Most prediction models, e.g. effort estimation, 
require preprocessing of data. Some datasets, such as ISBSG, contain 
data quality meta-data which can be used to filter out low quality cases
 from the analysis. However, an agreement has not been reached yet 
between researchers about these data quality selection criteria.Aims: 
This paper aims to analyze the influence of data quality meta-data 
criteria in the number of selected projects, which can have influence in
 the models obtained. For this, a case study has been selected to gain a
 more complete understanding of what might be important to focus in 
future research.Method: Data quality meta-data selection criteria of 
some works based on ISBSG dataset which propose prediction models were 
reviewed first. Considerable attention has been paid to two data quality
 meta-data variables in ISBSG dataset Release 11 which are Data Quality 
Rating and Unadjusted Function Point Rating. Secondly, this paper 
considers data from 830 projects which have been collected from the 
ISBSG dataset after a preliminary screening. This first screening leads 
mainly to a subset of projects with comparable definitions in size and 
effort. Then data quality meta-data criteria are applied in order to 
infer their influence.Results: Overall, it seems that data selection 
criteria, regardless data quality meta-data concerns, involve an 
important reduction in sample size. From 5052 projects, only 830 are 
really considered. Then 262 projects remain for analysis if the maximum 
quality rate is applied for both data quality meta-data variables. But, 
since the initial data preparation focuses the problem of missingness 
for a certain purpose, data quality criteria seem not to be the clue for
 the analysis results. However, some variability has been 
observed.Conclusions: Whilst this analysis is supported by a case study,
 it is hoped that it contributes to a better understanding of the 
subject. In fact, results found suggest that in those studies where the 
selection criteria of projects are not very strictly applied, these data
 quality criteria must be carefully taken into account.</td>

						<td>Identification and eradication of waste are the principal 
emphases of lean thinking. Waste is defined as any activity that 
consumes resources but does not deliver any value to the stakeholder and
 it can also be demarcated as an impediment to process flow. Lean 
thinking has been applied in the software engineering domain concerning 
overall software development, however, still, there is a need to take 
action regarding waste identification and elimination concerning 
specific software engineering activities. This paper describes the 
wastes generated during Modern Code Review (MCR). MCR is a 
socio-technical software engineering activity and acknowledged as a 
lightweight process for defect identification, code improvement and 
software quality enhancement. It involves coordination and communication
 among multiple software engineers having different personalities, 
preferences, and technical skills, thus it can generate multiple types 
of wastes. Therefore, the study has two objectives that are to recognize
 and report various wastes generated during MCR and to map the 
identified MCR wastes on the existing software engineering wastes. 
Systematic Literature Review and grounded theory has been utilized to 
recognize and produce a unique list of the waste generated during MCR. 
The identified unique list of MCR wastes and their mapping on existing 
software engineering wastes are validated through software engineering 
experts. The study findings report 28 unique wastes out of which 25 
wastes map to the existing software engineering wastes. However, 3 
wastes such as negative emotions, inequality/biasness and insignificant 
feedback are not reported in the existing software engineering 
literature. The study will be useful for researchers to identify the 
wastes in same context or for other software engineering activities and 
to provide the strategies to minimize the generation of identified 
wastes.</td>

			<h2>Software Paradigms, Assessment Types and Non-Functional

						<td>Context: In modern systems, like cyber-physical systems, where
 software and physical services are interacting, safety, security or 
performance play an important role. In order to guarantee the correct 
interoperability of such systems, with respect to functional and 
non-functional requirements, integration testing is an effective measure
 to achieve this. Model-based testing moreover not only enables early 
definition and validation, but also test automation. This makes it a 
good choice to overcome urgent challenges of integration testing. 
Objective: Many publications on model-based integration testing (MBIT) 
approaches can be found. Nevertheless, a study giving a systematic 
overview on the underlying software paradigms, measures for guiding the 
integration testing process as well as non-functional requirements they 
are suitable for, is missing. The aim of this paper is to find and 
synthesize the relevant primary studies to gain a comprehensive 
understanding of the current state of model-based integration testing. 
Method: For synthesizing the relevant studies, we conducted a systematic
 literature review (SLR) according to the guidelines of Kitchenham. 
Results: The systematic search and selection retrieved 83 relevant 
studies from which data has been extracted. Our review identified three 
assessment criteria for guiding the testing process, namely static 
metrics, dynamic metrics and stochastic &amp;amp;random. In addition it 
shows that just a small fraction considers non-functional requirements. 
Most approaches are for component-oriented systems. Conclusion: Results 
from the SLR show that there are two major research gaps. First, there 
is an accumulated need for approaches in the MBIT field that support 
non-functional requirements, as they are gaining importance. Second, 
means for steering the integration testing process, especially together 
with automation, need to evolve.</td>

 high quality product. Such processes can be described in many different

 Before dealing with the overall goal of improving the description of 
development processes, this paper evaluates what process descriptions 
look like in practice and why they look like they do, with special focus
 on the degree of formality. Method: Based on a structured, semi-formal 
interview guideline with open and closed questions, a series of twelve 
interviews was conducted in German companies of different sizes (from 
ten to several thousand employees). The interview results were used for 
an analysis to come up with findings regarding the current usage of and 
need for software process models or descriptions. Results: In general, 
our results confirm the literature statement that in industrial practice
 the majority of processes focus on description rather than using formal
 notations or models. Nevertheless, they use semi-formal process 
descriptions containing different graphical, table-based, or 
structured-text elements for representation. Conclusions: It is 
interesting that even if companies do not want to use formal models, 
they would like to have the advantages offered by them. Our findings 
provide evidence of the state of the practice regarding usage and show 
the need for future work in this area of describing and modeling

interesting that even if companies do not want to use formal models, 
they would like to have the advantages offered by them. Our findings 
provide evidence of the state of the practice regarding usage and show 
the need for future work in this area of describing and modeling 
development processes.</p>

						<td>The C language leads a double life: as an application 
programming language of yesteryear, perpetuated by circumstance; and as a
 systems programming language which remains a weapon of choice decades 
after its creation. This essay is a C programmer's reaction to the call 
to abandon ship. It questions several aspects commonly held to define 
the experience of using C; these include unsafety, undefined behaviour, 
and the motivation of performance. It argues all these are in fact 
inessential; rather, it traces C's ultimate strength to a communicative 
design which cannot be understood within the usual conception of "a 
programming language", but can be seen as the antithesis of so-called 
"managed" languages. This communicativity is understood as facilitating 
the essential aspect of system-building: creating parts which interact 
with other remote parts—being "alongside" not "within", and of "alien" 
origin.</td>

						<td>App store-inspired elicitation is the practice of exploring 
competitors' apps, to get inspiration for requirements. This activity is
 common among developers, but little insight is available on its 
practical use, advantages and possible issues. This paper aims to 
empirically analyse this technique in a realistic scenario, in which it 
is used to extend the requirements of a product that were initially 
captured by means of more traditional requirements elicitation 
interviews. Considering this scenario, we conduct an experimental 
simulation with 58 analysts and collect qualitative data. We perform 
thematic analysis of the data to identify strategies, benefits, and 
challenges of app store-inspired elicitation, as well as differences 
with respect to interviews in the considered elicitation setting. Our

<p>App store-inspired elicitation is the practice of exploring 
competitors' apps, to get inspiration for requirements. This activity is
 common among developers, but little insight is available on its 
practical use, advantages and possible issues. This paper aims to 
empirically analyse this technique in a realistic scenario, in which it 
is used to extend the requirements of a product that were initially 
captured by means of more traditional requirements elicitation 
interviews. Considering this scenario, we conduct an experimental 
simulation with 58 analysts and collect qualitative data. We perform 
thematic analysis of the data to identify strategies, benefits, and 
challenges of app store-inspired elicitation, as well as differences 
with respect to interviews in the considered elicitation setting. Our 
results show that: (1) specific guidelines and procedures are required 
to better conduct app store-inspired elicitation; (2) current search 
features made available by app stores are not suitable for this 
practice, and more tool support is required to help analysts in the 
retrieval and evaluation of competing products; (3) while interviews 
focus on the why dimension of requirements engineering (i.e., goals), 
app store-inspired elicitation focuses on how (i.e., solutions), 
offering indications for implementation and improved usability. Our 
study provides a framework for researchers to address existing 
challenges and suggests possible benefits to fostering app 
store-inspired elicitation among practitioners.</p>

tackling this issue. From a review of the motivators and barriers

Support Systems can be enhanced by these features and thus support 
better decision-making within organizations. However, there is not a 
clear understanding of ongoing works that investigate the interplay and 
commonalities of these two topics. In this context, this work reports 
the results of a systematic mapping study carried out to provide an 
overview of ongoing studies on the software architecture of the decision
 support system to support visual analytics features. Study findings 
clearly showed that even though visual analytics features might be 
incorporated on software architectures, there is still a need for 
further research clarifying means of modelling and representing these 
features on architectural styles.</td>

machinery power to process large data volumes, as well as human 
reasoning to discover new insights hidden in enterprise data. Decision 
Support Systems can be enhanced by these features and thus support 
better decision-making within organizations. However, there is not a 
clear understanding of ongoing works that investigate the interplay and 
commonalities of these two topics. In this context, this work reports 
the results of a systematic mapping study carried out to provide an 
overview of ongoing studies on the software architecture of the decision
 support system to support visual analytics features. Study findings 
clearly showed that even though visual analytics features might be 
incorporated on software architectures, there is still a need for 
further research clarifying means of modelling and representing these 
features on architectural styles.</p>

						<td>Background: Little is known about the practices used for 
technical debt (TD) payment. The study of payment practices, as well as 
the reasons for not applying them, can help practitioners to control and
 manage TD items. Aims: To investigate, from the point of view of 
software practitioners, if TD items have been paid off in software 
projects, the practices that have been used to pay off TD and the 
reasons that hamper the implementation of these practices. Method: We 
analyzed - both quantitatively and qualitatively - a corpus of responses
 from a survey of 432 practitioners, from four countries, about the 
possibility of TD payment. Results: We found that, for most of the 
cases, TD items have not been eliminated from software projects. The 
main reasons for not paying off TD are lack of organizational interest, 
low priority on the debt, focus on short-term goals, cost, and lack of 
time. On the other hand, we identified that code refactoring, design 
refactoring, and update system documentation are the most used practices
 for TD payment. Practitioners also cited practices related to the 
prevention, prioritization, and creation of a favorable setting as part 
of TD payment initiatives. Conclusion: This paper summarizes the 
identified practices and reasons for not paying off debt items in a map.
 Our map reveals that the majority of payment practices are of a 
technical nature while the majority of reasons for not paying off debts 
are associated with non-technical issues.</td>

The quality of software architectures determines sustainability to a

practice. We thus provide a systematic literature review assessing 
scenario-based methods for sustainability support and categorize more

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>Context: the Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that 
provides an ecosystem for a fast-growing quantity of connected devices, 
also defined as cyber-physical devices. Problem: the creation of 
Internet of Things solutions is fairly complex, having to integrate and 
communicate between sensors, devices, and larger systems, presenting 
many technical challenges not present in the same magnitude as other 
paradigms. One of the most affected segments is the development of 
cyber-physical devices. Much of its development energy is spent on the 
connecting and efficacy of these devices, often overlooking the future 
impacts of the proposed solution, caused by a lack of software quality. 
Solution: The execution of a Systematic Mapping in order to bring 
attention to possible research gaps. SI Theory: This work follows the 
accepted protocols for systematic mappings, meta-analysis, and 
Hermeneutics. Methodology: this paper executes a systematic mapping, 
following well-accepted guidelines in order to systematically gather, 
include and classify scientific papers according to IoT devices’ own 
characteristics. Results: 8146 studies were found and reduced to 211 
relevant studies that focused on client-side IoT development had their 
data graphed and analyzed. Our results show a lack of software metrics 
used, many research gaps and correlations were discovered, when in 
respect to specific software quality properties as described by the 
ISO25010 and other characteristics collected, such as programming 
languages and study domain. Contributions: The main contribution of this
 study is to expose multiple research gaps present in IoT client-side 
development. Providing a background for future information system 
studies on techniques and tools to improve IoT development.</td>

<p>Context: the Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that provides an 
ecosystem for a fast-growing quantity of connected devices, also defined
 as cyber-physical devices. Problem: the creation of Internet of Things 
solutions is fairly complex, having to integrate and communicate between
 sensors, devices, and larger systems, presenting many technical 
challenges not present in the same magnitude as other paradigms. One of 
the most affected segments is the development of cyber-physical devices.
 Much of its development energy is spent on the connecting and efficacy 
of these devices, often overlooking the future impacts of the proposed 
solution, caused by a lack of software quality. Solution: The execution 
of a Systematic Mapping in order to bring attention to possible research
 gaps. SI Theory: This work follows the accepted protocols for 
systematic mappings, meta-analysis, and Hermeneutics. Methodology: this 
paper executes a systematic mapping, following well-accepted guidelines 
in order to systematically gather, include and classify scientific 
papers according to IoT devices’ own characteristics. Results: 8146 
studies were found and reduced to 211 relevant studies that focused on 
client-side IoT development had their data graphed and analyzed. Our 
results show a lack of software metrics used, many research gaps and 
correlations were discovered, when in respect to specific software 
quality properties as described by the ISO25010 and other 
characteristics collected, such as programming languages and study 
domain. Contributions: The main contribution of this study is to expose 
multiple research gaps present in IoT client-side development. Providing
 a background for future information system studies on techniques and 
tools to improve IoT development.</p>

						<td>The concept of transparency allows stakeholders to learn and 
understand the elements and processes in the context of web portals for 
collaborative development, being a fundamental requirement for a 
software ecosystem (SECO) platform. Its absence brings problems 
regarding the communication between developers as well as the 
understanding of the provided information, being harmful to SECO health.
 In this context, this paper presents a tool to allow the evaluation of 
characteristics that contribute to a SECO portal transparency, called 
T2-UXT. To do so, this tool produces visual artifacts and indicators 
from the user's experience. An initial evaluation with SECO developers 
was performed to demonstrate the use of T2-UXT. Android and iOS SECO 
portals were selected and developers' interaction in the execution of 
five tasks on both pages were monitored. The results show that T2-UXT 
generates indicators that assist in the transparency evaluation process 
for SECO portals.</td>

						<td>Background: Distributed data-intensive systems are 
increasingly designed to be only eventually consistent. Persistent data 
is no longer processed with serialized and transactional access, 
exposing applications to a range of potential concurrency anomalies that
 need to be handled by the application itself. Controlling concurrent 
data access in monolithic systems is already challenging, but the 
problem is exacerbated in distributed systems. To make it worse, only 
little systematic engineering guidance is provided by the software 
architecture community regarding this issue. Aims: In this paper, we 
report on our study of the effectiveness and applicability of the novel 
design guidelines we are proposing in this regard. Method: We used 
action research and conducted it in the context of the software 
architecture design process of a multi-site platform development 
project. Results: Our hypotheses regarding effectiveness and 
applicability have been accepted in the context of the study. The 
initial design guidelines were refined throughout the study. Thus, we 
also contribute concrete guidelines for architecting distributed 
data-intensive systems with eventually consistent data. The guidelines 
are an advancement of Domain-Driven Design and provide additional 
patterns for the tactical design part. Conclusions: Based on our 
results, we recommend using the guidelines to architect safe eventually 
consistent systems. Because of the relevance of distributed 
data-intensive systems, we will drive this research forward and evaluate
 it in further domains.</td>

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>Boolean test input generation is the process of finding sets 
of values for variables of a logical expression such that a given 
coverage criterion is achieved. This paper presents a formal framework 
in which evaluating an expression produces a tree structure, and where a
 coverage criterion is expressed as equivalence classes induced by a 
particular transformation over these trees. It then defines many 
well-known coverage criteria as particular cases of this framework. The 
paper describes an algorithm to generate test suites by a reduction 
through a graph problem; this algorithm works in the same way regardless
 of the criterion considered. An experimental evaluation of this 
technique shows that it produces test suites that are in many cases 
smaller than existing tools.</td>

						<td>Background: The knowledge and application of tools to automate
 testing is essential to ensure software reliability and therefore its 
quality. Due to the increasing demand for quality in software projects 
executed in short time-scales, Testing as a Service (TaaS) appeared in 
the literature as contributions for cost reduction and productivity of 
automated tests. Aims: Once quality attributes from these contributions 
are not deeply discussed by the literature of the area, our goal is to 
investigate and identify these attributes from the TaaS platforms and 
providers commonly reported in the literature. Method: A protocol was 
formulated and executed according to the guidelines for performing 
systematic literature map in Software Engineering. Results: The TaaS 
providers and platform proposals found were classified according to the 
number of mentions in the literature, highlighting the most commonly 
mentioned and widespread. As well as the propagation and explanation of 
the main advantages and disadvantages reported in the literature on 
Testing as a Service. Conclusions: TaaS provides means for cost 
reduction and increase in productivity in comparison to traditional test
 approaches. This is a reality observed in 76 options for Test as a 
Service cloud platforms distributed over 52 papers. In addition, as 
their quality attributes, we also found eight groups of disadvantages 
and 21 of advantages. Thus, this systematic mapping is a valuable 
contribution for decision making on performance testing strategies.</td>

						<td>Context: Smart Cities are urban areas that enable the 
development of applications to improve city resources management, 
through the use of information technology such as Internet of Things and
 cloud computing, as well as government data availability and citizen 
participation. Some challenges identified in the development of 
solutions for this context are: scalability, modularity and security. 
Goal: Testing activities are critical to the verification and validation
 of Smart City solutions, so our goal is to develop a map of test 
strategies for applications developed in the context of Smart Cities. 
Method: For this study we defined a systematic literature review 
protocol to identify, select, analyze and synthesize the results of 
previously published empirical studies in the software engineering 
literature, related to testing Smart Cities applications. Results: In 
this systematic mapping, 13 articles were selected, that have identified
 test strategies used by developers for the application testing process.
 We have also identified some difficulties faced in the process of 
testing these applications through reports present in the works selected
 in this mapping. Conclusion: Our research synthesized evidence that we 
hope might serve as a data source for academic research and industrial 
practice. As future work we plan to apply our results highlighting a 
case study in real applications to validate the collected evidence.</td>

						<td>Smart home systems are becoming an integral feature of the 
emerging home IT market. Under this general term, products mainly 
address issues of security, energy savings and comfort. Comprehensive 
systems that cover several use cases are typically operated and managed 
via a unified dashboard. Unfortunately, research targeting user 
experience (UX) design for smart home interaction that spans several use
 cases or covering the entire system is scarce. Furthermore, existing 
comprehensive and user-centered longterm studies on challenges and needs
 throughout phases of information collection, installation and operation
 of smart home systems are technologically outdated. Our 18-month Living
 Lab study covering 14 households equipped with smart home technology 
provides insights on how to design for improving smart home 
appropriation. This includes a stronger sensibility for household 
practices during setup and configuration, flexible visualizations for 
evolving demands and an extension of smart home beyond the location.</td>

<p>Smart home systems are becoming an integral feature of the emerging 
home IT market. Under this general term, products mainly address issues 
of security, energy savings and comfort. Comprehensive systems that 
cover several use cases are typically operated and managed via a unified
 dashboard. Unfortunately, research targeting user experience (UX) 
design for smart home interaction that spans several use cases or 
covering the entire system is scarce. Furthermore, existing 
comprehensive and user-centered longterm studies on challenges and needs
 throughout phases of information collection, installation and operation
 of smart home systems are technologically outdated. Our 18-month Living
 Lab study covering 14 households equipped with smart home technology 
provides insights on how to design for improving smart home 
appropriation. This includes a stronger sensibility for household 
practices during setup and configuration, flexible visualizations for 
evolving demands and an extension of smart home beyond the location.</p>

self-organizing teams with fluid boundaries and high possibility for

impact on developers&amp;amp;' sustained participation. Following a 
survey of 222 FOSS developers, we find conflict to have an overall 
negative effect on developer retention. Furthermore, different types of 
conflict have varying impact on outcomes. In particular, only normative 
conflict levels negatively impact intention to remain in a FOSS project.
 Both normative and process conflict negatively affect perceptions of 
team performance, while the co-occurrence of task and process conflict 
exacerbate negative effects on outcomes. Though we find structural 
factors like task interdependence and geographical distribution increase
 overall conflict levels in FOSS teams, participatory decision-making 
and a transformational leadership style have an ameliorating effect.

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>Background: Measuring an organization's capability to innovate
 and assessing its innovation output and performance is a challenging 
task. Previously, a comprehensive model and a suite of measurements to 
support this task were proposed. Aims: In the current paper, seven years
 since the publication of the paper titled Towards innovation 
measurement in the software industry, we have reflected on the impact of
 the work. Method: We have mainly relied on quantitative and qualitative
 analysis of the citations of the paper using an established 
classification schema. Results: We found that the article has had a 
significant scientific impact (indicated by the number of citations), 
i.e., (1) cited in literature from both software engineering and other 
fields, (2) cited in grey literature and peer-reviewed literature, and 
(3) substantial citations in literature not published in the English 
language. However, we consider a majority of the citations in the 
peer-reviewed literature (75 out of 116) as neutral, i.e., they have not
 used the innovation measurement paper in any substantial way. All in 
all, 38 out of 116 have used, modified or based their work on the 
definitions, measurements or the model proposed in the article. This 
analysis revealed a significant weakness of the citing work, i.e., among
 the citing papers, we found only two explicit comparisons to the 
innovation measurement proposal, and we found no papers that identify 
weaknesses of said proposal. Conclusions: This work highlights the need 
for being cautious of relying solely on the number of citations for 
understanding impact, and the need for further improving and supporting 
the peer-review process to identify unwarranted citations in papers.</td>

<p>Background: Measuring an organization's capability to innovate and 
assessing its innovation output and performance is a challenging task. 
Previously, a comprehensive model and a suite of measurements to support
 this task were proposed. Aims: In the current paper, seven years since 
the publication of the paper titled Towards innovation measurement in 
the software industry, we have reflected on the impact of the work. 
Method: We have mainly relied on quantitative and qualitative analysis 
of the citations of the paper using an established classification 
schema. Results: We found that the article has had a significant 
scientific impact (indicated by the number of citations), i.e., (1) 
cited in literature from both software engineering and other fields, (2)
 cited in grey literature and peer-reviewed literature, and (3) 
substantial citations in literature not published in the English 
language. However, we consider a majority of the citations in the 
peer-reviewed literature (75 out of 116) as neutral, i.e., they have not
 used the innovation measurement paper in any substantial way. All in 
all, 38 out of 116 have used, modified or based their work on the 
definitions, measurements or the model proposed in the article. This 
analysis revealed a significant weakness of the citing work, i.e., among
 the citing papers, we found only two explicit comparisons to the 
innovation measurement proposal, and we found no papers that identify 
weaknesses of said proposal. Conclusions: This work highlights the need 
for being cautious of relying solely on the number of citations for 
understanding impact, and the need for further improving and supporting 
the peer-review process to identify unwarranted citations in papers.</p>

						<td>The term 'software ecosystem' refers to a collection of 
software systems that are related in some way. Researchers have been 
using different levels of aggregation to define an ecosystem: grouping 
them by a common named project (e.g., the Apache ecosystem); or 
considering all the projects contained in online repositories (e.g., the
 GoogleCode ecosystem).In this paper we propose a definition of 
ecosystem based on application domains: software systems are in the same
 ecosystem if they share the same application domain, as described by a 
similar technological scope, context or objective. As an example, all 
projects implementing networking capabilities to trade Bitcoin and other
 virtual currencies can be considered as part of the same 
"cryptocurrency" ecosystem.Utilising a sample of 100 Java software 
systems, we derive their application domains using the Latent Dirichlet 
Allocation (LDA) approach. We then evaluate a suite of object-oriented 
metrics per ecosystem, and test a null hypothesis: 'the OO metrics of 
all ecosystems come from the same population'.Our results show that the 
null hypothesis is rejected for most of the metrics chosen: the 
ecosystems that we extracted, based on application domains, show 
different structural properties.From the point of view of the interested
 stakeholders, this could mean that the health of a software system 
depends on domain-dependent factors, that could be common to the 
projects in the same domain-based ecosystem.</td>

<p>The term 'software ecosystem' refers to a collection of software 
systems that are related in some way. Researchers have been using 
different levels of aggregation to define an ecosystem: grouping them by
 a common named project (e.g., the Apache ecosystem); or considering all
 the projects contained in online repositories (e.g., the GoogleCode 
ecosystem).In this paper we propose a definition of ecosystem based on 
application domains: software systems are in the same ecosystem if they 
share the same application domain, as described by a similar 
technological scope, context or objective. As an example, all projects 
implementing networking capabilities to trade Bitcoin and other virtual 
currencies can be considered as part of the same "cryptocurrency" 
ecosystem.Utilising a sample of 100 Java software systems, we derive 
their application domains using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) 
approach. We then evaluate a suite of object-oriented metrics per 
ecosystem, and test a null hypothesis: 'the OO metrics of all ecosystems
 come from the same population'.Our results show that the null 
hypothesis is rejected for most of the metrics chosen: the ecosystems 
that we extracted, based on application domains, show different 
structural properties.From the point of view of the interested 
stakeholders, this could mean that the health of a software system 
depends on domain-dependent factors, that could be common to the 
projects in the same domain-based ecosystem.</p>

						<td>Open Source Software (OSS) has changed drastically over the

popular products, involving industry participation, and providing 
professional career opportunities. But our field's understanding of what
 motivates people to contribute to OSS is still fundamentally grounded 
in studies from the early 2000s. With the changed landscape of OSS, it 
is very likely that motivations to join OSS have also evolved. Through a
 survey of 242 OSS contributors, we investigate shifts in motivation 
from three perspectives: (1) the impact of the new OSS landscape, (2) 
the impact of individuals' personal growth as they become part of OSS 
communities, and (3) the impact of differences in individuals' 
demographics. Our results show that some motivations related to social 
aspects and reputation increased in frequency and that some intrinsic 
and internalized motivations, such as learning and intellectual 
stimulation, are still highly relevant. We also found that contributing 
to OSS often transforms extrinsic motivations to intrinsic, and that 
while experienced contributors often shift toward altruism, novices 
often shift toward career, fun, kinship, and learning. OSS projects can 
leverage our results to revisit current strategies to attract and retain
 contributors, and researchers and tool builders can better support the 
design of new studies and tools to engage and support OSS development.</td>

						<td>In the last few years, artificial intelligence (AI) and 
machine learning (ML) have become ubiquitous terms. These powerful 
techniques have escaped obscurity in academic communities with the 
recent onslaught of AI &amp;amp; ML tools, frameworks, and libraries 
that make these techniques accessible to a wider audience of developers.
 As a result, applying AI &amp;amp; ML to solve existing and emergent 
problems is an increasingly popular practice. However, little is known 
about this domain from the software engineering perspective. Many AI 
&amp;amp; ML tools and applications are open source, hosted on platforms
 such as GitHub that provide rich tools for large-scale distributed 
software development. Despite widespread use and popularity, these 
repositories have never been examined as a community to identify unique 
properties, development patterns, and trends.In this paper, we conducted
 a large-scale empirical study of AI &amp;amp; ML Tool (700) and 
Application (4,524) repositories hosted on GitHub to develop such a 
characterization. While not the only platform hosting AI &amp;amp; ML 
development, GitHub facilitates collecting a rich data set for each 
repository with high traceability between issues, commits, pull requests
 and users. To compare the AI &amp;amp; ML community to the wider 
population of repositories, we also analyzed a set of 4,101 unrelated 
repositories. We enhance this characterization with an elaborate study 
of developer workflow that measures collaboration and autonomy within a 
repository. We've captured key insights of this community's 10 year 
history such as it's primary language (Python) and most popular 
repositories (Tensorflow, Tesseract). Our findings show the AI &amp;amp;
 ML community has unique characteristics that should be accounted for in
 future research.</td>

					<th>Resumo</th>
						<td>Twitter is widely used by software developers. But how 
effective are tweets at promoting open source projects? How could one 
use Twitter to increase a project's popularity or attract new 
contributors? In this paper we report on a mixed-methods empirical study
 of 44,544 tweets containing links to 2,370 open-source GitHub 
repositories, looking for evidence of causal effects of these tweets on 
the projects attracting new GitHub stars and contributors, as well as 
characterizing the high-impact tweets, the people likely being attracted
 by them, and how they differ from contributors attracted otherwise. 
Among others, we find that tweets have a statistically significant and 
practically sizable effect on obtaining new stars and a small average 
effect on attracting new contributors. The popularity, content of the 
tweet, as well as the identity of tweet authors all affect the scale of 
the attraction effect. In addition, our qualitative analysis suggests 
that forming an active Twitter community for an open source project 
plays an important role in attracting new committers via tweets. We also
 report that developers who are new to GitHub or have a long history of 
Twitter usage but few tweets posted are most likely to be attracted as 
contributors to the repositories mentioned by tweets. Our work 
contributes to the literature on open source sustainability.</td>

<p>Twitter is widely used by software developers. But how effective are 
tweets at promoting open source projects? How could one use Twitter to 
increase a project's popularity or attract new contributors? In this 
paper we report on a mixed-methods empirical study of 44,544 tweets 
containing links to 2,370 open-source GitHub repositories, looking for 
evidence of causal effects of these tweets on the projects attracting 
new GitHub stars and contributors, as well as characterizing the 
high-impact tweets, the people likely being attracted by them, and how 
they differ from contributors attracted otherwise. Among others, we find
 that tweets have a statistically significant and practically sizable 
effect on obtaining new stars and a small average effect on attracting 
new contributors. The popularity, content of the tweet, as well as the 
identity of tweet authors all affect the scale of the attraction effect.
 In addition, our qualitative analysis suggests that forming an active 
Twitter community for an open source project plays an important role in 
attracting new committers via tweets. We also report that developers who
 are new to GitHub or have a long history of Twitter usage but few 
tweets posted are most likely to be attracted as contributors to the 
repositories mentioned by tweets. Our work contributes to the literature
 on open source sustainability.</p>

						<td>Considering the fact that the process by which software is 
developed influences the final product quality, companies are concerned 
with their process definitions. However, defining a software process is a
 complex activity, as well as a risky one. In this scenario, different 
software process reuse techniques have been proposed in the literature, 
such as Software Process Line (SPrL). SPrL provides a systematic way to 
support software process reuse, aiming to increase the reuse potential, 
risk reduction, among other benefits. However, SPrL is not being widely 
used in industry yet, mainly due to the lack of support, e.g., SPrL 
evolution support. SPrL evolution research topic investigates the 
modifications (e.g., maintenance, improvement, tailoring) performed 
during the SPrL lifecycle and helps to understand and manage them. 
Although it has not been appropriately explored by previous studies, it 
is important to support SPrL useful life extension through enabling 
practices and technologies. Aware that engineers often try to learn from
 their natural counterparts to solve problems following approaches in 
nature, this paper analyzes four theories of biological evolution aiming
 at interpreting its concepts and terms within the SPrL evolution 
context. Different SPrL evolution’s open research points were observed. 
It is expected that this work supports future investigations to propose a
 biology-based approach to support SPrL evolution.</td>

						<td>The underlying principles of Sustainable Software Engineering 
are a core set of competencies Software Engineers need for defining, 
building, and running sustainable software applications. However, 
despite its importance, recently published studies have shown that 
Software Engineers have not reached a common and clear understanding of 
Sustainable Software Development (SSD). Consequently, it might be 
challenging to understand the value of the principles behind 
sustainability and how Software Engineers should apply them in practice.
 Therefore, the first step is to promote a field characterization to 
mitigate such effects to bridge such a gap. This paper reports on 
qualitative data analysis to leverage the sustainability principles 
through the support of the Grounded Theory method. We conducted this 
study using unstructured data retrieved from a systematic mapping study 
on sustainable software engineering and a survey applied in the software
 industry. To achieve the principles, we considered five critical 
dimensions: economic, social, individual, environmental, and technical. 
The key results are: (i) technical, environmental, and social concerns 
are present in all software development life-cycle (SDLC) phases; (ii) 
software engineers should consider sustainability requirements in the 
early SDLC phases; (iii) there is a need for stakeholder engagement 
focused on sustainability; (iv) software quality requirements support 
the development of sustainable software; and (v) sustainable concerns 
could generate trade-offs in the project. The yielded results might 
trigger further discussions around the SSD’s underlying principles and 
concepts and serve as a basis for the research community to identify 
models, techniques, and tools to support SSD.</td>

“critical” projects through manual analysis and automated tools, 
including aspects such as sustainability, funding, community engagement 
and adherence to security policies. The results of the analysis will be 
presented on a user-friendly web platform, which will allow users to 
view the health of individual OSS projects as well as the overall health
 of the OSS ecosystem. With this approach, the CrOSSD project provides a
 comprehensive and up-to-date view of the health of OSS projects, making

						<td>Supporting users in their daily activities, thus, making their
 lives more comfortable, has long been a goal for consumer-oriented 
systems development. With the rise of smart personal assistants (SPAs), 
however, we have reached a new milestone along the path towards this 
goal. These systems assist their owners by providing personalized and 
context-dependent information and service. Today's implementations reach
 from conversational agents, such as Siri, Cortana or Google Assistant, 
over chatbots, which are primarily text-based, to cognitive assistants, 
which assist according to a user's current cognitive or emotional state.
 However, although both research and practice proceed with full pace, 
recurring design elements of SPAs have not yet been investigated. We 
hence propose a pattern language for smart personal assistants to guide 
further empirical and design efforts. Therefore, we review existing 
information systems, computer science and human-computer interaction 
literature to find recurring design characteristics among 115 different 
assistants. The resulting pattern language contains 22 patterns that 
specify the interaction behavior and the intelligence of smart personal 
assistants.</td>

<p>Supporting users in their daily activities, thus, making their lives 
more comfortable, has long been a goal for consumer-oriented systems 
development. With the rise of smart personal assistants (SPAs), however,
 we have reached a new milestone along the path towards this goal. These
 systems assist their owners by providing personalized and 
context-dependent information and service. Today's implementations reach
 from conversational agents, such as Siri, Cortana or Google Assistant, 
over chatbots, which are primarily text-based, to cognitive assistants, 
which assist according to a user's current cognitive or emotional state.
 However, although both research and practice proceed with full pace, 
recurring design elements of SPAs have not yet been investigated. We 
hence propose a pattern language for smart personal assistants to guide 
further empirical and design efforts. Therefore, we review existing 
information systems, computer science and human-computer interaction 
literature to find recurring design characteristics among 115 different 
assistants. The resulting pattern language contains 22 patterns that 
specify the interaction behavior and the intelligence of smart personal 
assistants.</p>

						<td>Two of the main paradigms used to build adaptive software 
employ different types of properties to capture relevant aspects of the 
system's run-time behavior. On the one hand, control systems consider 
properties that concern static aspects like stability, as well as 
dynamic properties that capture the transient evolution of variables 
such as settling time. On the other hand, self-adaptive systems consider
 mostly non-functional properties that capture concerns such as 
performance, reliability, and cost. In general, it is not easy to 
reconcile these two types of properties or identify under which 
conditions they constitute a good fit to provide run-time guarantees. 
There is a need of identifying the key properties in the areas of 
control and self-adaptation, as well as of characterizing and mapping 
them to better understand how they relate and possibly complement each 
other. In this paper, we take a first step to tackle this problem by: 
(1) identifying a set of key properties in control theory, (2) 
illustrating the formalization of some of these properties employing 
temporal logic languages commonly used to engineer self-adaptive 
software systems, and (3) illustrating how to map key properties that 
characterize self-adaptive software systems into control properties, 
leveraging their formalization in temporal logics. We illustrate the 
different steps of the mapping on an exemplar case in the cloud 
computing domain and conclude with identifying open challenges in the 
area.</td>

<p>Context: many tech companies have had to adapt their software 
development processes to the reality of forced remote work due to 
COVID-19. Later, many of these companies transitioned to hybrid work, 
interspersing remote work with face-to-face work. Goal: this article 
aims to understand the challenges and impacts of this transition to 
software quality and to create hybrid software development teams. 
Method: an empirical study was carried out in the technology department 
of a Brazilian multinational company, using a multivocal literature 
review combined with a field study with semi-structured interviews and 
discursive textual analysis. Results: this study identified three main 
dimensions of the impact of the transition from remote to hybrid model: 
people, processes, and organization. In each of them, specific items 
were identified and will be detailed in this article. Conclusions: 
permanent or hybrid remote work models have enormous challenges and 
require studies in the specific scenarios of each company. It is 
necessary to understand these challenges to propose solutions that 
simultaneously facilitate the work of teams and guarantee the quality of
 the projects.</p>

						<td>Cyber-physical systems integrate computational and physical 
processes and allow for smart applications like smart transportation, 
smart buildings, and safety systems. While some applications support us 
in our daily life, others are safety-critical like vehicular active 
safety systems. Systematic testing of such critical cyber-physical 
systems is a crucial, but very challenging task that so far has received
 little research attention. In this paper, we present an investigation 
on the state-of-the-art and future trends of testing critical 
cyber-physical systems on the example of active safety systems for 
vehicles. We conducted four focus groups with Swedish industrial 
partners as well as systematically studied proceedings of a recent 
active safety conference. Our results show that while the main testing 
processes and scenarios are supported, there is a clear need to enable 
testing of more complex scenarios in realistic settings, as well as 
increasing the degree of automating therefor to achieve better 
repeatability and a more effective test resource usage.</td>

<p>Cyber-physical systems integrate computational and physical processes
 and allow for smart applications like smart transportation, smart 
buildings, and safety systems. While some applications support us in our
 daily life, others are safety-critical like vehicular active safety 
systems. Systematic testing of such critical cyber-physical systems is a
 crucial, but very challenging task that so far has received little 
research attention. In this paper, we present an investigation on the 
state-of-the-art and future trends of testing critical cyber-physical 
systems on the example of active safety systems for vehicles. We 
conducted four focus groups with Swedish industrial partners as well as 
systematically studied proceedings of a recent active safety conference.
 Our results show that while the main testing processes and scenarios 
are supported, there is a clear need to enable testing of more complex 
scenarios in realistic settings, as well as increasing the degree of 
automating therefor to achieve better repeatability and a more effective
 test resource usage.</p>

						<td>Background: The software engineering community has 
increasingly conducted systematic literature reviews (SLR) as a means to
 summarize evidence from different studies and bring to light the state 
of the art of a given research topic. While SLR provide many benefits, 
they also present several problems with punctual solutions for some of 
them. However, two main problems still remain: the high 
time-/effort-consumption nature of SLR and the lack of an effective 
impact of SLR results in the industry, as initially expected for SLR. 
Aims: The main goal of this paper is to introduce a new view — which we 
name Sustainability of SLR — on how to deal with SLR aiming at reducing 
those problems. Method: We analyzed six reference studies published in 
the last decade to identify, group, and analyze the SLR problems and 
their interconnections. Based on such analysis, we proposed the view of 
Sustainability of SLR that intends to address these problems. Results: 
The proposed view encompasses three dimensions (social, economic, and 
technical) that could become SLR more sustainable in the sense that the 
four major problems and 31 barriers (i.e., possible causes for those 
problems) that we identified could be mitigated. Conclusions: The view 
of Sustainability of SLR intends to change the researchers' mindset to 
mitigate the inherent SLR problems and, as a consequence, achieve 
sustainable SLR, i.e., those that consume less time/effort to be 
conducted and updated with useful results for the industry.</td>

						<td>[Context] Accurate time estimation is a critical aspect of 
predictable software engineering. Previous work shows that low source 
code quality increases the uncertainty in issue resolution times. 
[Objective] Our goal is to evaluate how developers’ project experience 
and file ownership are related to issue resolution times. [Method] We 
mine 40 proprietary software repositories and conduct an observational 
study. Using CodeScene, we measure source code quality and active 
development time connected to Jira issues. [Results] Most source code 
changes are made by either a marginal or dominant code owner. Also, most
 changes to low-quality source code are made by developers with low 
levels of ownership. In low-quality source code, marginal owners need 
45% more time for small changes, and 93% more time for large changes. 
[Conclusions] Collective code ownership is a popular target, but 
industry practice results in many dominant and marginal owners. Marginal
 owners are particularly hampered when working with low-quality source 
code, which leads to productivity losses. In codebases plagued by

<p>[Context] Accurate time estimation is a critical aspect of 
predictable software engineering. Previous work shows that low source 
code quality increases the uncertainty in issue resolution times. 
[Objective] Our goal is to evaluate how developers’ project experience 
and file ownership are related to issue resolution times. [Method] We 
mine 40 proprietary software repositories and conduct an observational 
study. Using CodeScene, we measure source code quality and active 
development time connected to Jira issues. [Results] Most source code 
changes are made by either a marginal or dominant code owner. Also, most
 changes to low-quality source code are made by developers with low 
levels of ownership. In low-quality source code, marginal owners need 
45% more time for small changes, and 93% more time for large changes. 
[Conclusions] Collective code ownership is a popular target, but 
industry practice results in many dominant and marginal owners. Marginal
 owners are particularly hampered when working with low-quality source 
code, which leads to productivity losses. In codebases plagued by 
technical debt, newly onboarded developers will require more time to

software systems that depend on those libraries (the clients) should 
update their dependencies to use these new versions as the new release

 However, updating is not always a smooth process, as it can result in 
software failures in the clients if the new version includes breaking 
changes. Yet, there is little research on how these breaking changes 
impact the client projects in the wild. To identify if changes between 
two library versions cause breaking changes at the client end, we 
perform an empirical study on Java projects built using Maven. For the 
analysis, we used 18,415 Maven artifacts, which declared 142,355 direct

dependencies and found that 11.58% of the dependency updates contain 
breaking changes that impact the client. We further analyzed these 
changes in the library which impact the client projects and examine if 
libraries have adhered to the semantic versioning scheme when

changes in transitive dependencies were a major factor in introducing 
breaking changes during dependency updates and almost half of the

						<td>As each micro community centered around the streamer attempts 
to set its own guidelines in live streaming communities, it is common 
for volunteer moderators (mods) and the streamer to disagree on how to 
handle various situations. In this study, we conducted an online survey 
(N=240) with live streaming mods to explore their commitment to the 
streamer to grow the micro community and the different styles in which 
they handle conflicts with the streamer. We found that 1) mods apply 
more active and cooperative styles than passive and assertive styles to 
manage conflicts, but they might be forced to do so, and 2) mods with 
strong commitments to the streamer would like to apply styles showing 
either high concerns for the streamer or low concerns for themselves. We
 reflect on how these results can affect micro community development and
 recommend designs to mitigate conflict and strengthen commitment.</td>

<p>As each micro community centered around the streamer attempts to set 
its own guidelines in live streaming communities, it is common for 
volunteer moderators (mods) and the streamer to disagree on how to 
handle various situations. In this study, we conducted an online survey 
(N=240) with live streaming mods to explore their commitment to the 
streamer to grow the micro community and the different styles in which 
they handle conflicts with the streamer. We found that 1) mods apply 
more active and cooperative styles than passive and assertive styles to 
manage conflicts, but they might be forced to do so, and 2) mods with 
strong commitments to the streamer would like to apply styles showing 
either high concerns for the streamer or low concerns for themselves. We
 reflect on how these results can affect micro community development and
 recommend designs to mitigate conflict and strengthen commitment.</p>

software engineering experiments. However the controversial results 
about its effects still need to be contextualized. This doctoral 
research will show how TDD could be better assessed by studying to what 
extent developers follow its cycle and for what kind of development 
tasks. This knowledge is foreseen to be beneficial for software

lines, methods, classes and packages that are more likely to contain 
faults. Recently, SFL tools have been proposed to help developers during
 debugging. These tools use different metaphors to represent the 
suspiciousness of program elements. In this paper, we compare two SFL 
tools that utilize different metaphors: Jaguar and CodeForest. Jaguar 
uses a textual representation, presenting the most suspicious elements 
of a program as a list sorted by suspiciousness. CodeForest uses 
three-dimensional visualization metaphor, presenting a program as a 
cacti forest in which basic blocks are represented as thorns, methods as
 branches, and classes as cacti. We present the results of an evaluation
 with 76 students using both tools. The perception of usability of the 
tools was assessed using a questionnaire based on the Technology 
Acceptance Model (TAM). Three factors were considered to measure the 
impact of use of the tools in the debugging activity: intention of use, 
usefulness, and ease of use. The results suggest that there is not 
statistical difference in the perception of usability between CodeForest
 and Jaguar.</td>

						<td>Background: Developers face challenges in building 
high-quality research software due to its inherent complexity. These 
challenges can reduce the confidence users have in the quality of the 
result produced by the software. Use of a defined software development 
process, which divides the development into distinct phases, results in 
improved design, more trustworthy results, and better project

Method: We surveyed research software developers to collect information

value in defined process. Results: Based on 98 responses, research 
software developers appear to follow a defined software development 
process at least some of the time. The respondents also have a strong 
positive perception about the value of following processes. Conclusions:
 To produce high-quality and reliable research software, which is 
critical for many research domains, research software developers must 
follow a proper software development process. The results indicate a

						<td>With the growing smartphone penetration rate, smartphone 
settings remain one of the main models for information privacy and 
security controls. Yet, their usability is largely understudied, 
especially with respect to the usability impact on underrepresented 
socio-economic and low-tech groups. In an online survey with 178 users, 
we find that many people are not aware of smartphone privacy and 
security settings, their defaults, and have not configured them in the 
past, but are willing to do it in the future. Some participants perceive
 low self-efficacy and expect difficulties and usability issues with 
configuring those settings. Finally, we find that certain 
socio-demographic groups are more vulnerable to risks and feel less 
prepared to use smartphone settings to protect their online privacy and 
security.</td>

metric that leverages machine learning and a comprehensive collection of
 logs data to identify periods of related actions (indicating focus), 
and validate this metric against self-reported time in focus or flow 
using diary data and quarterly survey data. Our results indicate that we
 can determine when software engineers at a large technology company 
experience focused work which includes instances of flow. This metric 
speaks to engineering work, but can be leveraged in other domains to 
non-disruptively measure when people experience focus. Future research

						<td>Most suppliers in the automotive industry are facing the 
challenge of implementing Automotive SPICE, a domain-specific model of 
ISO/IEC 15504, which was first published in 2005. Original equipment 
manufacturers have increasingly requested SPICE certifications from 
their suppliers in order to effectively evaluate the development 
processes and identify reliable partners. To support organizations in 
their software process improvement effort, the Software Engineering 
Institute (SEI) developed the IDEAL model. This guide is, however, 
influenced by the SEI's work on CMM and based on the experiences with 
very large organizations. The goal of this paper is to examine the 
suitability of the IDEAL model for the implementation of Automotive 
SPICE at a medium-sized R&amp;amp;D department. Preliminary results from
 an action research study at a global systems engineering company are 
discussed. The data indicate that adjustments are especially needed with
 regard to the factors participation and communication. Also, informal 
networks between companies, early decision-making and usability are 
shown to play an important role and might be added to the model.</td>

						<td>Data visualization aims to effectively communicate 
quantitative information by understanding which techniques and displays 
work better for different circumstances and why. There are a variety of 
software solutions capable of generating a multitude of different 
visualizations of the same dataset. However, data visualization exposes a
 large space of visual configurations depending on the type of data to 
be visualized, the different displays (e.g., scatter plots, line graphs,
 pie charts), the visual components to encode the data (e.g., lines, 
dots, bars), or the specific visual attributes of those components 
(e.g., color, shape, size, length). Researchers and developers are not 
usually aware about best practices in data visualization, and they are 
required to learn about both the design practices that make 
communication effective and the low level details of the specific 
software tool used to generate the visualization. This paper proposes a 
software product line approach to model and materialize the variability 
of the visualization design process, guided by feature models. We encode
 the visualization knowledge regarding the best design practices, 
resolve the variability following a step-wise configuration approach, 
and then evaluate our proposal for a specific software visualization 
tool. Our solution helps researchers and developers communicate their 
quantitative results effectively by assisting them in the selection and

 technologies themselves have been considered, we explore the underlying
 software development and programming approaches. We therefore conduct a
 detailed media content analysis of twenty-seven movies that examines 
the role of software development in science fiction by identifying and 
investigating new approaches to programming and how software development
 is conceptualized portrayed within science fiction scenes. With the 
additional analysis of eighteen design fiction stories exploring the 
scenario “What if everyone is able to program?”, we envision potential 
impacts of the democratization of software development on business and 
society. Our study opens new discussions and perspectives, by 
investigating the current vision of the future of programming and 
uncovers new approaches to software development which can serve as a 
starting point for further research in the HCI community.</td>

technologies themselves have been considered, we explore the underlying 
software development and programming approaches. We therefore conduct a 
detailed media content analysis of twenty-seven movies that examines the
 role of software development in science fiction by identifying and 
investigating new approaches to programming and how software development
 is conceptualized portrayed within science fiction scenes. With the 
additional analysis of eighteen design fiction stories exploring the 
scenario “What if everyone is able to program?”, we envision potential 
impacts of the democratization of software development on business and 
society. Our study opens new discussions and perspectives, by 
investigating the current vision of the future of programming and 
uncovers new approaches to software development which can serve as a 
starting point for further research in the HCI community.</p>

						<td>Open source is experiencing a renaissance period, due to the 
appearance of modern platforms and workflows for developing and 
maintaining public code. As a result, developers are creating open 
source software at speeds never seen before. Consequently, these 
projects are also facing unprecedented mortality rates. To better 
understand the reasons for the failure of modern open source projects, 
this paper describes the results of a survey with the maintainers of 104
 popular GitHub systems that have been deprecated. We provide a set of 
nine reasons for the failure of these open source projects. We also show
 that some maintenance practices—specifically the adoption of 
contributing guidelines and continuous integration—have an important 
association with a project failure or success. Finally, we discuss and 
reveal the principal strategies developers have tried to overcome the 
failure of the studied projects.</td>

<p>Open source is experiencing a renaissance period, due to the 
appearance of modern platforms and workflows for developing and 
maintaining public code. As a result, developers are creating open 
source software at speeds never seen before. Consequently, these 
projects are also facing unprecedented mortality rates. To better 
understand the reasons for the failure of modern open source projects, 
this paper describes the results of a survey with the maintainers of 104
 popular GitHub systems that have been deprecated. We provide a set of 
nine reasons for the failure of these open source projects. We also show
 that some maintenance practices—specifically the adoption of 
contributing guidelines and continuous integration—have an important 
association with a project failure or success. Finally, we discuss and 
reveal the principal strategies developers have tried to overcome the 
failure of the studied projects.</p>

						<td>Team members commonly collaborate on visual documents remotely

 this setting as they often do not share work schedules or physical 
workspaces. As communication in this setting has delays and limits the 
main modality to text, members exert more effort to reference document 
objects and understand others’ intentions. We propose Winder, a Figma 
plugin that addresses these challenges through linked tapes—multimodal 
comments of clicks and voice. Bidirectional links between the clicked-on
 objects and voice recordings facilitate understanding tapes: selecting 
objects retrieves relevant recordings, and playing recordings highlights
 related objects. By periodically prompting users to produce tapes, 
Winder preemptively obtains information to satisfy potential 
communication needs. Through a five-day study with eight teams of three,
 we evaluated the system’s impact on teams asynchronously designing 
graphical user interfaces. Our findings revealed that producing linked 
tapes could be as lightweight as face-to-face (F2F) interactions while 
transmitting intentions more precisely than text. Furthermore, with 
preempted tapes, teammates coordinated tasks and invited members to 
build on each others’ work.</td>
